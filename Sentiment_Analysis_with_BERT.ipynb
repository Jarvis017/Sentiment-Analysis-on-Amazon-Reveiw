I Bought it for clinicals because I need a watch that can withstand a lot of handwashing and this one is water resistant to 100 meters, which means you can go swimming and snorkeling with it. It's functional, has the perfect size, matches with everything, and pretty to look at!  I love it!\n",

            "The watch looks very nice, however, it was $30 more expensive compared to other very similar Seiko 5 Sport watches, so I'm not sure it I paid the right price. Besides the price, the accuracy is extremely poor, there is a 5 min delay every 3 weeks, making it very hard to follow the correct time. If I could return it right now I will do it right away, it took me too long to notice this issue. Don't waste your money and get a different watch!!!\n",
            "Nice color scheme (the white/gray dial is kind of fancy). The bracelet is definitely cheap but you can throw a replacement at any time (right now I am using it with a black/white/red NATO).

            "I really loved the watch I bought it as a gift for my cousin and I am sure she will love it . Infact i ordered two other watches with this but now I am thinking of returning those two and order two more of these . One advice: its wont be so good for skinny wrists as it wont fit nicely . Its a really nice buy\n",
            "It's a Mako. Enough said.\n",
            "The lighting that indicates the various times is brighter in some spots on the watch. Not the same brightness on all lines\n",
            "This is a watch I've been wearing for over 7 years now, and I have recently decided to write some reviews of items that I bought from Amazon a while ago. Most of the reviews are from people who have recently bought the watch, so I hope I can provide a different point of view.<br /><br />I do own quite a few watches, I have a few Casios, Skagens, Timexs, a Tissot, a Pebble etc. This Seiko however, is my everyday watch.<br /><br />It is reliable, very light, and a good looking watch. I had to change the battery only once in the 7 years I owned it.<br /><br />At 37 mms, the dial is rather small, so if you have large wrist, you may want a watch with a bigger dial.<br /><br />I don't think the titanium band looks cheap at all, I think the color and the feel is just right. The only con I have for this watch is that it shows wear and tear. It scratches rather easily, but it doesn't bother me all that  I think it makes for a decorative look.<br /><br />The other thing I would have wanted from this watch is the water resistance capability. It is WR 50 meters, and you know what that means: Do not take it near water! I would not even shower with it. But it is all a trade off you see... You want a real water resistant watch, you get bulkier, heavier watches. I prefer the light weight for an everyday watch.<br /><br />All in an all, I gave this watch 4 stars after seven years. I would buy it again without any hesitation today if my old one had gone missing.\n",
            "Awesome watch. Really great quality. Nice packaging.\n",
            "Like the picture shows. Very happy with it.\n",
            "Sorry but it came with no directions on how to set the thing.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone.\n",
            "Battery was dead upon receipt\n",
            "Bought for a gift for my Son. He looooves this watch. Good product.\n",
            "I really like this. It was great for the price. I love the color and face. It came on time, and working. The only thing is that it is a little too big, even on the smallest button.\n",
            "This thing is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! If you want something very unique but super cool, this will fit the bill! The band is leather and the embroidery section is really pretty. Because it's truly embroidered, it's a little stiff in that section of the band but I think will bend more over time. I just love this watch and love the idea of it. This was an effortless transaction. The watch zoomed to me from the seller!

            "I bought this &#34;Hiwatch Silicone 50M waterproof Digital Sports Watches Date Time Alarm Week With Gift Box Black&#34; for my husband, who is deployed. He absolutely loves it. He is quite rough on any watch or electronic device that he has and they normally don't last long. The quality of this watch definitely feels as if it will last a very long time. I enjoy how it blinks with the seconds and does tell the day of the week with the date.<br />It has many size notches, which is perfect because my husband has tiny wrists for a guy. It lights up nicely and the tint that it came in he is reusing for his cigarettes so they don't get smashed in his ruck. Overall I'm extremely happy with this great and durable watch. I'll update if that changes, but I don't expect it to.\n",

            "Love the item very nice!\n",
            "Love this watch, am used to much more expensive watches, but this one is great for weekend wear. Super light, water proof, and if you lose it, $15 not the end of the world.\n",
            "I ordered this watch by mistake, thinking it was a womans watch because of the pink in it. I had to return it because it was HUGE. However it was beautifull and heavy. Wish it was in a womans size though.\n",
            "Excellent watch for price and is extremely stylish\n",
            "Love this watch... Wear it everyday!! Color still vibrant. Great choice\n",
            "Very nice band, but for an every day sporty watch that gets sweaty and wet on a regular basis, I would not buy. Like every other leather band I've tried, it will get a bit funky ( smell ) after a couple weeks use. I ended up buying an expensive natural ruber band. This doesn't look or feel as nice, but is completely water/stink proof.\n",

            "A really accurate watch. Looks good. Nice size. Only downfall is the 30m water resistant. But if you don't plan to go swimming, A good buy.\n",

            "The Casio Model DQ-750F Digital Alarm Clock is a great product with large clock digits (~1.2 inches/31mm height) and a beautiful blue/green electro-luminescent (EL) backlight.  It has simple controls that are very easy to set the time & alarm without reading the included manual and uses AA x2 batteries.  The alarm beep is loud enough without being too annoying.  I anticipate them to last at least 20 years like my previous Casio alarm clock that I finally had to replace since I wore out the setup switch since I constantly change my wake up time for weekday/weekend.  It is made in China like so many things. My initial delivery of two clocks were both defective with missing LCD segments.  Vendor was prompt to send out two replacement items which seem to be defect free so far. I would buy from Watchtonics via Amazon again.  Thanks to all involved!\n",

Explained a G shock should last longer than one year and again was told they will do nothing. Not consumer friendly experience.\n",

The bracelet is solid.Under the dial you can see the heart of the mechanical system. It even has the manufacturer name engraved on the clasp and in the dial itself.The seller, ddshopping in China shipped my watch in only one hour! WOW!! They also personally sent me the tracking number and contacted me with updates as my watch went through both theirs  and the USPS delivery.Best of all, they ship by air to the U.S.A. A beautiful watch at a beautiful price! Top it off with a seller like ddshopping and you have a winning combination. A great item and seller for Amazon.\n",

            "Looks good and expensive. In terms of quality not really one to bother about.\n",
            "This watch has everything that I was looking for and could possibly need in a watch. I have had it for about 3 months so far and continue to love it. Due to the multitude of features, it can be difficult to remember how to use them all, but the manual is very thorough.  Once you use it a few times, it is fairly easy to figure out, but all the features can be overwhelming at first.  The construction is sturdy and it feels solid when you wear it. The only drawback is that the band can sometimes be difficult to undo, but I think that is by design so the band does not become accidentally snagged or undone because the watch is meant to be used in rugged conditions.  Other than that, I have nothing bad to say about it thus far.\n",
            "Everything  broke first time out returned\n",
            "I bought this watch at the beginning of the summer because I was going to be swimming all the time.  It is a wonderful watch and actually matches most of my clothes so it can stay on most of the time.  After reading the description and looking at the pictures it is just as expected.  Very happy!\n",
            "Broke within the first 3 months of ownership.  The watch is nice, especially the skeleton winding mechanism.  Makes it a shame that the date dial broke off.  Additionally, the metal scratches very easily.  I bought it as a flash deal which leaves me getting what I paid for.\n",
            "This watch has a surprisingly solid build, strong materials, a decent band, and quite an attractive watch head.<br />'<br />Definitely not hollow feeling. The head feels sturdy, has a heavy feel, and has a nice shine The font and alarm hands are easy on the eyes.<br /><br />Modern, sleek, and looks great for every day use.\n",

            "Excellent, thank you\n",
            "My 12 year old daughter was looking for something with the capabilities of the Timex Triathlon watch, but fit a tween-age girls fashion sense.  Black and purple, what else could you ask for?<br /><br />She uses the alarm and timer daily (tracking how much of her allotted video game time has been used) - and it was easy to learn and use.  Function and tween-age approval.  Perfect combination!\n",
            "The item I ordered arrived earlier,watch band is silicone, very soft. 5 stars !\n",
            "It's absolutely fantastic!! The product came on time and it looks great.\n",
            "Well made with real leather and indiglo - a watch I can see both men and women liking, with a somewhat military appearance but also simple and stylish. However the battery was running down a month before I'd had it even one year. For all you out there who might not know - when watches began to be mass produced in the 70's, batteries were designed to last at 5 years or more. I had one watch that was still running after 7 years. One year is ridiculous.\n",
            "the watch is bigger than the illustration. after a month when I entered the pool water marks appeared unfurtunatly.\n",
            "I have it 4 stars because the only thing that I can say that I don't like about this watch is on the face the day and date Windows are very very small and difficult to read, I own other invictas and they usually have a small magnified bubble that allows you to see it. That's the only thing I dislike about this product, other than that it is a magnificent timepiece and very comfotabke to wear.\n",
            "Love it were it almost always\n",
            "Just what I was looking for.\n",
            "Like just about everyone else here, I love the watch and HATE the band. I've just had another rubber strap fail (perish around the sizing slots), having nearly lost this timepiece to the bottom of the ocean on several occasions! An the support from CITIZEN - utter utter utter RUBBISH!!!<br /><br />I tried to be too clever by half and ordered the steel bracelet for the BJ2105-51E (looks identical), but no dice, it doesn't fit! So now that I've basically purchased the watch twice with all the straps I've bought, this one is likely to be retired, unless I can find some clever machinist who can shape me some loops so I can attach a standard NATO strap. Such a shame Citizen...such a shame.\n",
            "I am VERY happy with my new Fossil watch. The watch is &#34;BOSS' with the blue dial and high quality black leather band which is retro 70's. (do you remember boomers?) The only negative is that it is a little hard to read even though the display is big during daylight as the colors and finishes kind of blend together. Also the hands are not illuminating in the dark. I thought they were supposed to be activated by the sun. But maybe its Seattle, it is sunny here now, but me, I avoid the sun a little so that might be it.\n",
            "The instructions for this watch are in tiny print and very confusing. There is a diagram of the watch face with the four buttons on the side of the watch. The diagram shows A, B, C and D. Then there is an insert that shows the purpose of A (Reset), B (Mode),  C (ST/STP), D (Light). I really like the light. Apparently, you to go through the whole sequence of changing the time to change the date. For my arthritic hands, it is very difficult to hold down one button, nevermind two buttons at the same time. I finally ended up, using a magnifying glass to see the instructions and making a word document in print large enough for me to see.<br /><br />It took me an hour and half to set the time. I was really interested in the alarm because I need a daily alarm but I am so worn out from setting the time that I am going to save that for another time.<br /><br />The watch is very pretty, I have had jelly watches before and liked the way that they look. It is also comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I would not recommend it for a senior citizen because of the size of the print of the instructions and the difficulty in holding the buttons.\n",
            "good looking and accurate.  great price\n",
            "Feels good. Good quality. Clean. Nice lines. Wide face. The manual isn't for this watch but if you can't figure out how to use this watch, don't buy it. Overall I am satisfied. More Diesel watches to buy..\n",
            "Thank you!\n",
            "Bought this for my fianc&eacute; as an anniversary gift . he loved it ! and so did I . shipping was fast & free . so glad that I bought it .. it's a big smaller than the picture but if fit him perfect even a bit loose . loved how it looked on him ! !!!\n",
            "very nice.\n",
            "This Swiss Legend is a beautiful watch, sure to impress the ladies and built to last a lifetime. When it was offered to me for the price of a review, I couldn't resist. However, if a watch originally marked at close to a thousand dollars is discounted down to $174.99  there must be a reason for it. In today's age of lightweight, waterproof watches that not only tell time but also monitor heart rate, count how many steps you walk, and countless other apps, this one is an old fashioned time piece with a few drawbacks.<br />The watch is not only heavy, but it is also bulky and awkward. If you're active and exercise regularly or do physical labor, the watch is impractical. However, if you're an international traveler and want a status symbol this might work. Another drawback is that the watch band is so large that it fits perfectly around my ankle so I'll have to take it to a jeweler to have links taken out of the band and wear it only for dress. So, whether or not you buy this watch depends on why you want a watch and your lifestyle.\n",
            "Very thick and beautiful.\n",
            "Light weight and easy the wear. The watch arrived quickly with the extra link in side the box rather than needing to be removed. I'll probably by another because it the most unique watch I've owned.\n",
            "I bought 2 of these, plus 2 more of the black ones, with the last one before that, they all &#34;reset to 00:00&#34; for some strange reason.  The time ends up being just slow enough to really make me late when I need to be somewhere on time. Would have given it one star, but I don't hate the watch.  This watch has been evolving since my first Casio in 81 or 82, and has everything I need in a watch. They need a harder glass on them to resist scratching too.  ¥¥¥\n",
            "My watch is the 7016X model... only difference is that mine has a leather wrist band.  Was a great watch... for about 18 months.  In short order, the wrist band fell apart, the battery died and now it loses about 4 minutes a day.  Very disappointed. Will not buy a Wenger product again as I begin to shop around for a replacement.\n",

            "This was a gift...and I could not be more pleased. It is even more attractive than the picture, and the box it came in is very cool.<br /><br />Great value!\n",
            "I knew it was big, and I'm okay with that. However, the hour hand only moves about a half an hour. So, major  function...track time accurately = fail.<br />Function...use for jewelry = pass.<br />Over all fail.\n",
            "I really liked this watch, nice piece, but, I wanted a white dial or face, I returned it\n",

Clearly ....my money was wasted..... Never again....never again.  Worthless business practice ..... Trust is what I value....  In return ..... I got nothing.   Nothing....\n",

            "works well\n",
            "Nice looking watch, really durable and pretty much water proof if you don't dive too deep.  Perfect for keeping time while soaking in the pool or snorkeling in the ocean...which I did every day all day for a week on vacation and the watch was submerged or wet the whole time.  The watch still works great and looks good.\n",
            "The Casio watch is quite sophisticated: energy renewable and atomic precision. Unfortunately it is a little small for my eyes.<br />Size of the case is ~ 42 mm. Product arrives on time Return was processed quickly. I  already bought another Casio watch I can see numbers and characters..\n",
            "I love it a lot 👍👍👍👍😀😀😀😀\n",
            "Originally I really liked this pocket watch. After two weeks, I noticed it had stopped. So, naturally, I gave it a couple of quick turns. Nothing. I only gave it two or three turns, so there's no chance that I over wound it. It just completely stopped working. I honestly wasn't expecting much for $4, but I was kind of hoping it would last a few months. Oh well.\n",
            "Not your usual watch winder which mimics wrist movement, just rotates clockwise and counterclockwise, smooth action\n",
            "Beautiful watch!!  The snakeskin strap is more gold than the picture but still looks great.\n",
            "I recieved this product in exchange for a review.  This watch is so cool. I love that it just looks like a bracelet unless u push the button. It was really east to set the time and when it shows the time ots very cool looking.\n",
            "Excellent piece.<br /><br />* Very elegant and sturdy design<br />* I love the fact that is not shinny, but a matte finish<br />* I like the color-line around it; It adds a very nice touch<br />* Cushions are also well made and soft, but do keep their shape<br /><br />The only concern I must express is that while all cushions are armed with watches, there seems to be a enought room/space for the watches to tilt to sides.  But this could be one's personal preference as some may find it a plus when pullling one the watch to wear.<br /><br />I certainly recommend it and would buy again both as gift and personal.\n",
            "Looks great, fits like a glove and works great. The leather is super nice, both with respect to wear and fit. It's like it comes broken in yet looks beautiful. Khaki and green camo on the face complements both the brown leather of the strap and the military-looking studs. Haven't had it long enough to check the time, but appears to be accurate over a week of having it. The chronograph keeps hundredths of a second accuracy. AVI-8 has a winner here.\n",
            "The description of the watch says blue dial watch but when delivered it is black dial watch.<br />This is very dissappointing.\n",
            "This watch is much prettier in person. Very sparkly and shiny. Love it!\n",
            "I really like this watch its very stylish and classy. The only problem I have with this watch it's really loose on my wrist and I don't know how to tighten up the slack : (\n",
            "Fantastic looking watch. Received item fast from seller and could not be more happy with my purchase. I have only been wearing for 2 weeks and I have gotten many complements on a daily basis. Also, Amazon had it cheaper than at other sellers.\n",

            "A battery is a battery.  It works.\n",
            "The strap looks great, but it must be really absorbent. Keep in mind, I wear it in a fast paced restaurant environment, so I sweat with it a lot, but it smells bad enough that I can't wear it anymore, and I tried to clean it thoroughly. If anyone has some advice on how to clean the leather I guess let me know?\n",
            "Nice watch at a great price! It looks more expensive than what it costs. If you have a big wrist than this is probably not for you as this watch is a little slim\n",

            "Solid with some limitations, concurred.<br />I second the referenced review, with a few added points:<br />-The packaging was indeed perfect, mine came in three separate boxes: an initial shipping box, a second packing box, and finally the product shoe-box type, which was enclosed by an inch of foam on both ends.<br /><br />-One note concerning the construction: while it seems that the drawers are permanently in place to hinder inspection of the entirety of the humidor's construction, I reached up under the top of the humidor and my fingers hit plastic of some sort. You'll have to decide if this is something you can live with, I personally don't see it as an issue when compared to glass top humidors.<br /><br />My specific product came with a few minor scratches on the top edges, but was otherwise mint. I have yet to season and put it to use, I will leave a<br />second review when this has been done.<br /><br />Overall first impression: a beautiful piece that fits the aesthetic theme of its surroundings. It is well and beautifully built, and will be nicely complimented with other additions from the same series.\n",

            "Excellent product, very fast delivery!\n",
            "This muscular watch was just too big for my tastes - it seems to be designed for bigger wrists. I am average height and my wrist measures about 6-3/4&#34;, so the watch strapped in at the second smallest hole position. It would be too large for wrists under about 6-1/2&#34;. The watch case diameter is larger than specified, measuring 44.5mm diagonally across the face (so, not including the crown.) The case is nearly 11mm thick. It is heavier than watches I'm used to, weighing in at 2.5oz or 70g.  It is a nice, if oversized, looking watch. The numbers are clear and easy to read, including the date. The hands are only visible at the tips. The time could be easier to read if the arms were not black like the face, though.\n",
            "The watch is pretty awesome for the price.  I have had it for several months and it is holding up just fine.  The band and clasp are indeed &#34;cheap&#34;, but they haven't broken or shown signs of wear.  For the price, it's worth the purchase, it's a cool looking watch that if it breaks you're not out hundreds of dollars.\n",
            "Strap too small. Says men's watch but sized for a child. Had to change the band so would fit my man.\n",
            "Had bought an all black one that was outstanding and purchased this shortly thereafter.  Looks expensive for the price.  Would highly recommend.\n",

            "This band needs to clearly state it does NOT include the pieces needed to actually PUT IT ON THE WATCH! It's a nice enough band but I can't comment to it's comfort or anything having to do with wearing the band. For that I'll have to either spend another $10 for a tiny watch tool or take it to a jeweler. So right now it sits in the package. :-(\n",

            "have just had this a short time, but so far i am very happy with it. the big face design is just what i was looking for and the quality seems good. my son was visiting for the weekend and says he wants to get one-he is a watch aficionado .\n",

            "AUTHENTICITY – Summary: Watch was purchased directly from Amazon, not a third-party seller, and is a brand new (unused/unworn) genuine Breitling. Of course since Amazon is not a Breitling authorized dealer, I knew I would not receive a Breitling warranty certificate.  (This also is why the watch can be purchased for $2800 less than dealer’s price.)  I was skeptical about buying a Breitling on Amazon, but I am glad I did. More details below:  The watch looked great, but due to prevalence of high-quality counterfeits sold through non-authorized dealers, and having never seen this exact model in-person before, I started to become suspicious of what I perceived as potential flaws.  I contacted Amazon concierge customer service, (which connects customers to USA-based Amazon representatives who attend to high-dollar item issues.)  The Amazon rep was very courteous and helpful, and stated that while she doubted that the watch was not authentic, I could absolutely return it for a full refund.  (I chose to purchase the watch directly from Amazon as the vendor, due to Amazon return policy and customer service, and I have limited experience with third-party sellers of watches.)  I wanted to verify the watch was genuine Breitling (or not) and, as I happened to be rather close to their location, I personally took it to Breitling USA headquarters in Wilton, CT where they confirmed the watch was an authentic Breitling!  (The Breitling customer service representative I had previously spoken to on the phone came down to greet me, and then took the watch to the watchmakers on-site, who determined the piece was genuine. The rep was extremely pleasant, polite and helpful, and although she stated Breitling could not provide me anything in writing to indicate or affirm the authenticity of the watch, they provided the inspection and confirmation of authenticity at no charge.) I would advise any buyer of a high value watch from Amazon to attain an expert inspection, either via the watch company themselves or an authorized dealer, prior to wearing the watch or having the band re-sized, just to be sure the piece is genuine. Bear in mind a dealer might charge a fee for the inspection.  WATCH APPEARANCE: Many photos of this watch can be found by doing an online image search. I want to provide some guidance as to the appearance of the black color of the bezel:  In most professional photos of this watch, including the one here on Amazon, the black bezel color looks like a pitch or “inky” pure black.  In direct bright light the color is closer to a dark charcoal matte grey.  In low or indirect light, the black does look more like “pure black.”  The point is that depending on the type of lighting, the black bezel color will look slightly different. This is not surprising since the material is actually black vulcanized rubber which is embedded in the bezel and completely flush with the stainless steel numeral markers. I've included pics of watch in different lighting.  ACCURACY: The watch's automatic movement is a COSC certified chronometer and should keep time within -4 / +6 seconds per 24 hours. I have had the watch 4 days, and it is running about 6.7 seconds fast after a 24 hour period (or .7 second faster than spec range.)  Various online watch forum discussions state that Breitlings need a few weeks or a month to “settle in” and many people have state their Breitlings started out fast but after a few weeks were within specification.  Others state watches should be within the COSC specification from day one.  Personally, I do not know which is true, but I’m hoping my watch will “slow down” just a little in the coming weeks.  Regardless, I can live with gaining 6.7 seconds per day.  The watch is beautiful and a delight to own!\n",
            "honestly great watch didn't expect it to be this good. Looks great and works great.\n",
            "Beautiful watch, appears to be well made, and everything works as it should. The watch was thoroughly packaged and well protected for shipping. So far, I'm quite pleased !\n",

Don't buy it for the Diamonds.<br />+/-The face being mother of pearl to me is cool, but not very noticeable.  Though it does look good when you do notice it.\n",

Just from looking at it I think he's going to like it a lot. This is the second Akribos watch I've bought and I'm in love with this brand.\n",
            "It's fit very well!!\n",
            "very beautiful watch, I only gave 4 stars because I would have like a little more size to the dial face. other than that its pretty nice, I get a lot of complements on it. the blue it nice and shine in the sun. I have to remove 3 links.\n",
            "Disclosure:This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this watch. I really love accessories made out of wood and have been looking at watches like this one for awhile. However, When I received the product I was disappointed. The watch I received looks like a cheaper version of the one pictured on the companies amazon account. The face of the watch i received looks to be a wood grain sticker and not actual wood like the one pictured on amazon. It also has a completed different wood pattern and the logo is on top instead of on bottom. I wish that the logo was engraved but that is just a preference that I believe would make the watch look more natural. The watch is light which is nice and the actual watch that houses all the components is real bamboo. However, I would like an explanation as to why the watch I received looks very different than the one pictured on the seller's account.\n",
            "It didn't work.  however, thanks to Amazon the problem was easy to resolve.\n",
            "Tremendous\n",
            "This watch has survived A LOT of abuse and still works like a charm. The face is scratched a little from a few pretty bad falls but it's a minor scratch. There are a lot of holes in the band which is nice for someone with small wrists. The multiple timezones is also nice for someone who travels a lot. It takes a little bit to get used to navigating using the 4 buttons but that would be my only complaint. For the price, i don't think I could have gotten a better watch that suits the needs of a traveler.\n",
            "Great watch, delivered on time!\n",
            "cute! adjustable too\n",
            "I get a lot of compliments on this watch. It is large and heavy and good quality and design. That and the white color makes it stand out. I don't like the date dial. I personally cannot read the date because it is so small and the numbers are hard to figure out. It is also very easy to accidentally hit the day and date buttons and change the date, so they are never accurate anyway. But they look cool.\n",
            "Awesome #\n",
            "I purchased two of these at two different times and both times the hard plastic part holding the rubber straps broke within a month or so. I wear my watches securely, but not tight and not too loose either. There's is no explanation for this, other than a faulty, poo quality product. One would have to replace the whole plastic frame holding the watch face and connecting the strap. Normally, I would try to gerry-rig it and wear it anyway, but you can't even do that, because the whole plastic frame broke: twice, with two different watches! This is junk, way too cheap. I will not purchase again and do not recommend it.\n",
            "Too cute. Love it.\n",
            "Very nice looking and stylish.\n",
            "Best looking most comfortable non-leather band I've found. I prefer leather, but they always end up a bit funky ( stinky) so I'm trying this. So far it's all good.\n",
            "The watch was a bit &#34;lightweight&#34;. I am used to watches that are somewhat heavier. However, it was cute and it worked.\n",
            "Possibly one of the most elegant Citizen watches I've bought. The face is more of a light grey than bright white, and the hands aren't quite as sharp blue as in the picture, but in person, I think it actually looks better (albeit a bit different) that represented here. I am very pleased with it.\n",
            "OK Besty Johnson is one queen of different love her fashion styles and this watch is soooooo dang cute and stylist\n",
            "I received my watch strap in record time - only to realize I had ordered the wrong color.  I emailed Clockwork Synergy and quickly received a return email with a return label for the watch strap, and notification that the correct color had already been sent out to me!  The strap is beautiful and will definitely enhance my Pebble Steel.  I am also so impressed with the Customer Service - that's how to create and keep loyal customers!\n",
            "This was a gift and well liked.\n",
            "Love the watch I plan on ordering another one soon😁\n",
            "Sometimes you need a watch that brings.  If you're like me and you're still a couple years from owning your first big-time watch, this is a great piece.  I did remove the chain as I thought it was a bit over the top, but the watch is great.  The gold plating is done correctly and looks like a solid gold case.  Beautiful, big and bold.  Great for those days when you're closing a deal with a client.  Stop reading this and buy it!\n",
            "Good\n",
            "This is perfect for an everyday watch! I also have the black leather strap model and love both just as much. Unlike several other reviews I haven't seen the wear that is supposed to have shown but the strap is rather dull so I'll keep it for now as a frequently worn but not everyday watch to kronor nice looking. I'd definitely recommend for your next watch purchase!\n",
            "Beautiful watch for $95. I bought 2 more after for gifts after received the 1st one\n",
            "My only problem with the watch is that it came with a different band than what is pictured, which is more of an inconvenience than anything else. Both the supplied band and watch feel and look like something of a high quality so this is a great buy for the price if the leather band doesn't bother you.\n",
            "Bought this for a friend a while back. The links keep falling apart. Cheaply made for what I paid.\n",
            "It fell apart immediately...\n",

            "It's broken already after 8 weeks and I can't return. Horrible.\n",
            "I purchased this to replace one from a different company that broke.  I have had the new band on my watch for 2 days and.... one of the little straps came loose  and fell off.  Without these little straps to hold the end of the watchband in place, the watch band can easily come off your wrist.\n",
            "This is very affordable sport watch. I have been using it every time I do my running session and it is still working upto now.\n",
            "Wear it when swimming. Works nice.  Excellent watch considering the price.\n",

            "Superb watch at a superb price...In England this is almost double...although at the moment it's not available anywhere...but should you come across one..get it..It looks even more fabulous in real life then on the photo...I bought this to go with my collection and do not actually wear it...but I have on occassion and when I do someone always notices it and remarks on it...This is just a fablulous complication watch to be admired without doubt...VCheers\n",
            "Beautiful piece!\n",
            "Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. The band is somewhat big around his wrist though.\n",
            "Best watch I've ever owned. In fact, I'd like to add more Citizens to my collection.\n",
            "Good product and good price. Seamless transaction!\n",
            "At the time of this review, the initial battery has lasted 3.75 years (still working fine). The timekeeping is very accurate on this watch, going multiple years without deviating more than a minute from actual time.\n",
            "This watch looks like, and is packaged like a $15 watch. Of course it isn't real gold, but the manufacturer couldn't even polish it. When it isn't polished it looks more like bronze, and when it is polished it looks clearly like fake gold, or at best crude gold paint. At first glance it looks fancy with a cheap pleather band, but when you look close enough the entire watch looks cheap. Even the case is cheap, with an ugly pillow that holds the watch. The packaging mine came in had what looks like dried glue staining it. If you get it for under $20 and it doesn't break in the first few months its not a bad deal. I only had mine for about 24 hours, so these are simply first impressions. It would probably make for a great first 'hand wind' watch. If you don't like the idea of winding your watch once a day after you've owned this one, then you probably wouldn't want a $200 investment that you would need to hand wind.\n",
            "The product picture is not accurate as the inner side of the leather is black instead of khaki shown here, though the watch itself is perfect.\n",
            "My husband loves it, and it was about half the price of buying it from a regular store that sells Navy SEAL watches.\n",
            "It looks so nice!! It was a little weird at first because I didn't know how to open it and put it in lol I bought it for my boyfriend. It's a very nice watch! I hope he likes it as much as I do!\n",
            "Good Plastic!\n",
            "The watch itself is sturdy and beautiful. It can be a bugger to set but I got with patience.  The band is not nearly as dark as pictured.  In the pictures, it looks black  but the one I got is a medium grey.  I don't mind it has a worn look that I think looks good.  I do love the watch.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the band color.\n",
            "This watch really stands out and quickly became my go to watch. The face is really a brushed silver, something that is lost in all the photos and it is incredible. The red layer beneath provides great accents. The size is just right, big enough to feel, thicker than it looks, but not overwhelming. I highly recommend.\n",
            "sharp timepiece\n",
            "I liked... But its not small. A bit large, not as delicate as it could be\n",
            "Beautiful watch.  I love the color of the face (light gold).  Easy to read.\n",
            "It is an excellent time piece\n",
            "This is a nice looking watch, however in the sunlight there is a strange shadow across the face of the watch. It's a little disconcerting and odd looking and I've never had a watch with this issue before.<br />If it weren't for the odd behavior in sunlight I would give it 5 stars\n",
            "The clock didn't work, very poor quality. You couldn't even adjust the time on the watch. and after I tried to adjust the time the second hand fell off. If I were you I would look somewhere else for a watch.\n",
            "If you love the G-Shock watch like I do, and your wristband has broken and you can't get the<br />someone. This is the band to get, find the color you like and install. &#34;Some model's may need adapter&#34;.\n",
            "it meet my expectations and also i received it on time\n",
            "good at first but promptly fell apart after less than 4 months usage.\n",
            "good\n",
            "Spring on band broke out after a week.\n",
            "I bought this watch for my husband & he loves it.  The band was large though. Did have to take some links out of it.\n",
            "Yep, cheap watch. The pin on the strap came off about 2 days in. Had to get a new one and superglue it in.<br />The watch is NOT GREEN, it is turquoise - does not even remotely look like the picture - at all.<br />So, you get what you pay for - it is a funky cheap watch that is a totally different color than advertised.\n",
            "It's a great watch.  We were so excited about the lay out to help my daughter learn how to read a clock.  The the minute numbers rubbed off in a day.  Do then she just got frustrated because it was hard to read.<br /><br />It's a great working watch.  And a Great idea with the minute numbers.  They just need to use something different in making the watch so the numbers stay.\n",
            "I can't get this watch to set to the correct time. All the directions are in a different language (other than English).\n",
            "Great look and comfort.\n",
            "Having issues with the day selector, the date is correct and spins correctly, the day selector, not so much. The day (when attempting to change what day it is) clicks while it spins but it does not change the day in the display. The hands do not &#34;charge&#34; unless light is applied directly to the face of the watch, it does not solar power or charge off of regular light. When it does charge after light being applied, it dies out quickly and does not stay illuminated for very long (maybe 20 minutes at best). I purchased this watch as I am a paramedic student, and will only be using it for the second hand. Just upset that $ spent on the watch and have only wore it for less than 1 day and its not preforming.<br /><br />UPDATE: Date does not change, Amazon sent the replacement, that was sticky, and has a dead battery in the watch, needless to say it is being returned to Amazon.\n",

            "tooooo small to see!!!!!!!\n",
            "So far so good.  Had it for a couple of weeks or so now and it seems pretty good.  Looks decent and the price was really cheap (around $16.00).  I go through watches quite often, maybe once every few years due to the type of work I do.  They get beat up pretty good so I don't like to spend too much money when I need a new one.  I have been buying Timex (in the $25-$45 range) for many years so now trying the Casio.  Time (ha ha) will really tell how great of a watch it truly is!\n",
            "Great watch, and unlike many other automatics I have purchased in this price range it actually keeps time.\n",
            "Really well made, looks like it was designed for the watch. Wish it was a little more adjustable...say in the buckle. That being said, I highly recommend this as an alternative to the stock band. I'm wearing it right now!\n",

            "For whatever reason, it doesn't keep track of the day properly. It seems to flip the day every 12 hours rather than every 24 hours, not sure why. The watch looks nice, though, and keeps the time reasonably well.\n",

Not disappointed at all, fact is a little impressed with some of the detail work and general look of the piece as well as quality. I have been let down by Invicta products in the past and this seems, at least these past days I have been using it, to be at least equal to those. Time will tell (pun intended). Of course the idea that I should get a work watch to do hobby tasks speaks volumes also, who wants to tune a car with a Rolex on or  garden in the mud with an Omega much less clean out gutters while enjoying a Tag Heuer. This watch, no matter the roots, seems just fine and I have people notice this much more than the others, odd don't you think. So Stuhrlung keep doing what you do.\n",

            "Good looking Swiss watch with a comfortable strap. It has luminous hands and beautifully designed. Loved the &#34;8&#34; motives.\n",

            "Excellent quality watch band. Top-notch leather, perfect stitching, padding and finish. Very nice patina right out of the box, and looks understated but definitely quality ... not a particularly dressy band, would work well on casual / sport style watches best, IMO.<br />I put it on a decent quality $85 casual watch (as in wear with button up shirt with khakis, nicer jeans, etc), and this band definitely &#34;upgrades&#34; the watch. Very pleased.<br /><br />Note on sizing: I got the &#34;regular&#34; length, and my wrist measures 7-1/2&#34; (wrapped a piece of string around wrist at the point wear watch is worn, then measured the string) - and I am using the 3rd hole from the end, which leaves just enough band to make it through the leather 'loop' ... in other words, any shorter and it wouldn't work. Hadley-Roma makes bands in &#34;Long&#34; length as well (about 1/4&#34; longer I think), and that might have been better, but I couldn't find the MSM882 in 'Long' and I really liked this band.<br /><br />That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to buy one of these bands again. beautiful band, very classy and understated.\n",
            "I bought it for my son. It looks great.\n",
            "Back in the 1980s, all digital watches came with little lights on the side that illuminated half the screen. Then, Timex came out with Indiglo, and it was a pretty blue light that lit the whole watch! It was amazing. Thereafter, all the illuminated watches used the backlighting, now even the cheap knockoffs. But, no! Not Casio! They doggedly kept to the little side light. It's gotten a little brighter, but it still is focused on part of the screen, creating a lot of glare against the glass.<br /><br />The description says &#34;EL backlight with Afterglow&#34;. I assumed/hoped this meant that the whole watch was brightly lit from the back, not a side light. (I also thought EL might have something to do with EL wire or EL paper, both of which have pretty glows). Sadly, it was not. The light is somewhat brighter than I've seen before, but I'd still prefer the full backlighting. Also, it doesn't stay on while you hold it down. After 1 second, it turns off automatically and you have to push the button again.<br /><br />Other than that, the watch is fine. I can change the time, use the stopwatch and timer. I had to look in the manual to find the 4 additional alarms; the interface isn't very intuitive. (The upper right button seems to be labeled &#34;autorepeat&#34;, but really only controls the light).<br /><br />There are a bunch of indicators on the face of the watch - I haven't figured out what all of them mean yet. In addition to the seconds listed next to the time, there's also a bar that fills up every 10 seconds. I believe the circle in the upper left shows which of the 5 alarms are on. There's a place that shows whether the first alarm is in snooze mode (it's the only one that can snooze). There's also a repeat cycle, which I assume is for the timer and/or stopwatch. I have no idea what &#34;SIG&#34; represents. So, there's plenty to entertain yourself by trying to figure it out.<br /><br />This is going to be my camping watch, so I don't need it to be amazing. For $13, it's pretty good, aside from the stupid light.\n",
            "Excellent product.\n",
            "My wife loved it!\n",
            "My friend love it so much. It looks the same as the picture.\n",
            "I bought this to replace the same watch my wife received from her step mother.  It is an excellent copy with the second hand added.  That is good.  The negative is I could find no way to adjust the expansion band, so I took the band off the old watch and put it on the new one.\n",
            "Great case for the price\n",
            "It's a nice watch, but small.  If it were bigger it would get more stars.  I love the Swatch quality, though.\n",
            "This watch is really beautiful in person. Subdued but regal shade of blue, & nice finish on the band. Very happy w/ this purchase.\n",
            "It fits nicely. Large face for reading the time, important for me. Neutral color goes with everything!\n",

            "this is a big, beefy watch that weighs almost a pound...<br /><br />designed for left-handers, this timepiece features a stopwatch button, time/date crown, reset button, synthetic sapphire crystal, second, minute and day wheels, along with analog hour and minute hands, and a sweep second hand for the stopwatch feature<br /><br />press the bottom button to start the stopwatch from the 12 o'clock position, press again to stop; press the top button to reset and the sweep hand will rotate back to noon - very nice!<br /><br />beefy band in brow leather - comes in sturdy box w/instruction booklet; face and back are covered in shipping film<br /><br />i'm taking off a star for poor, inconsistent luminescence on the dial (splotchy coverage)\n",
            "The band seems nice, the pins it comes with are too big to fit my watch.\n",
            "This is lightweight and pretty cheap quality but I didn't really expect alot at this price. Keeps accurate time. Chain appears nice.\n",
            "The strap is very heavy and appears it will be super durable. Downside for me is that there was not quite enough space under the pins of my watch to install such a heavy strap. I had to mark the spot on the strap that would be under the pin and clamp it in a vise to create a sharp bend in the strap to fit it under the pins. I have no doubt that the pins would snap before this strap would ever break.\n",
            "This watch is beautiful. I have gotten plenty compliments in a wide array of places including Best Buy and the subway. The watch is subtle but unique. Who needs or wants a big sparkly watch, when you can have this! The face is a perfect size and the strap is different yet comfortable. I thought it would get itchy and uncomfortable over time, I actually proactively bought a second wrist band but I've had this watch for 9 months and have experienced no discomfort whatsoever. Lastly the best feature of this watch is the solar power. I hate when I'm going to an event, put on my watch and it's not working!! With this watch I never have to worry about that. If you are in need of a watch, this product will not let you down!\n",
            "Not comparable to my other casio pro trek. This one is all plastic and not the same plastic that I'm expecting from Casio Watch.\n",
            "It's so beautiful and do not require a battery!\n",
            "Nice every day watch. It's strong and flexible. The band is not an issue to me at all unlike some reviewers complain about but I think I will replace it to make it look more expensive.\n",
            "strap broke before 3 months\n",
            "The only thing this watch is, is heavy. Could tell it wasn't black originally and has been cheaply painted. I don't know how it tells time because I had two watches shipped to me that didn't work. Extremely frustrating and inexcusable. Will not be buying from Uniprod again!\n",
            "Great,it's the one I like and dream of\n",

            "Great product.\n",
            "Love this watch. I like it like I do my Rolex president. This one is a gift. She loves it too. We never take them off, dishes, bathing or swimming in the lake. They are great, very reasonable and light on the wrist. You don't even know you're wearing it. See lives the black face. Mine is the pink face. This brand keeps perfect time and wears well. Way worth the money!!!\n",

            "Love this watch. It is exactly as it looks on the site. The face is a little over an 1&#34; wide. The band is about 1/2&#34; wide. The band seems to be made of a durable rubber. Of course, the colors are great and I've received lotsa compliments on it. I'm very happy with this purchase. The seller was great! It was an effortless transaction. Thank you!\n",
            "Nice watch.  I would like the digital display to be a little larger, but otherwise great watch\n",

            "nice looking watch.  I like its simplicity and classic design.  It's bit heavier than previous watches I have had and I had a hard time taking the segments off to adjust to my wrist size.  But in the end I am happy with it.\n",
            "This is going to be a short review. The hardware (buckle and pin) is decent. The colors are vivid with the a camo pattern reminiscent of the British army DPM camo pattern. Unfortunately, the band itself is so stiff that I found it very uncomfortable. This is supposed to be silicone, but felt like a poly strap in it's stiffness. The band itself is thick and perhaps that contributes to the rigidity. I do not recommend this product and give it only two stars.\n",
            "awesome workmanship.\n",

            "I waited almost a year to post a review, I wanted to be SURE!<br />WHAT A GREAT DIVING WATCH!<br />  *  Good looking<br />  *  Feel like quality product. It is heavy and solid.<br />  *  Bracelet can expand to go over your wetsuit<br />  *  Keep accurate time<br />  *  Price is incredably low for what it offers<br />  *  You are buying the equivalent of a $1,000 + diving watch (the one which are automatic - This one is a &#34;Solar&#34; and the solar is perfect even after a few days in the dark... Not once I had to adjust the time.<br />  *  The hands are wide and very visible when diving.... I did not try it a t 200 meters!<br />  *  The 3 screw buttons work very well and are effective not allowing any water in. Some review have complained about them... just be gentle and do not force them. Because I used the chrono all the time, I have to screw and unscrew them several times a day.<br />THE CHRONOGRAPH<br />  *  Well, I am not as positive, BUT I keep my 5 stars because it works AND I consider that at $200, I did not pay for it. Kind of a freebe.<br />  *  The Chrono works well but the priority (rightfully) was given to diving.<br />  *  The stopwatch's big hand for the seconds is excellent. However, after one hour it stops. So you are limited at timing anything within an hour only and the small dial giving you the elapsed minutes is small. Further more, because the 2 hands giving the time are so wide (good for diving), they often block the view of the dial (at 6:00 and every 30 minutes).<br />  * Seiko should have done a better job with the 3 accessory dials: 1) The one counting the seconds is good. 2) The one giving you the Military time is useless for me. 3) The one giving the elapsed minutes (chrono) is very hard to read and limitedto an hour.<br />  *  Some review have said that the day is hard to read. Yes, but how many time you need to look at your watch to see if we are the 4th or the 5th of July?<br />Bottom line, despite my comments, even the chronographis usefull and I use it several times a day.<br />NOW WE ARE IN 2017..<br />I have worn this watch almost on a daily basis. Even when I do not use it for a few days, it does not stop for lack of light. I never adjusted the time.<br />Yes I put it through the ringer, not only by using it, showering with it almost on a daily basis but also doing extensive snorkeling, diving with the sharks in the Galapagos, the turtles in Hawaii, AND NOW, how is my rating?<br />SAME. FIVE .<br />The watch still looks like new and all my above comments still stand. Some people have said it is heavy, for me it is a sturdy watch.\n",
            "Came before it was supposed to.  Very nice.\n",
            "The watch is beautiful, keeps perfect time and looks like a mans watch.  It was a birthday present to my self.\n",
            "I´m almost blind so I picked this watch out of all the watches out there.<br />I simply love it. I can finally see the time :) Plus people keep commenting on my watch and ask where I got it.\n",
            "Arrived on time.  Works as described.\n",
            "Very strong glass, its really beautiful and sturdy, lasted about 3months before one of the bands sloped off :/ but it was very very nice having. Fixible problem but kind of a hassle.\n",
            "I have a pretty large watch collection but ever since this one came in the mail, I can't get enough of wearing it.  It is perfectly big and unusual looking, very different from my other watches.  The vertical striping on the dial and the skeleton workings are just lovely..\n",
            "The watch head looks great. I've received several comments and compliments.<br />The leather band and the metal fasteners feel cheap and are difficult to fasten. The leather looks okay.<br />It's a mechanical watch and must be wound every morning and the time reset.<br />Unfortunately, the time quickly gets out of sync. I'll compare the watch to my phone and by noon it will already be slow (or fast) by 15 minutes.<br />So, as a watch, it's useless unless you want to repeatedly reset the time. Essentially it's jewelry for men.<br />Can't complain for the price and I'll still wear it because it is eye-catching. Too bad I can't rely on it to check the time.\n",
            "Although I loved this watch at first I have been really disappointed in the discoloration of the metal that I thought was meant to be really high quality. I'll probably have to end up getting a new watch soon.\n",
            "Great watch for the money. This is my second &#34;Weekender&#34; watch as I damaged my first one after five years of use. I removed the strap as my personal preference is a twist-o-flex stainless band. The night light feature comes in handy on dark late nights during camping trips!<br />Highly recommended for an every day time piece.\n",
            "The watch stopped working right away.\n",
            "Best value out there. This thing is handsome and indestructible.\n",
            "Awsome so far....excellent replacement. Package also came with unexpected  pins and pin tool.  Prime shipped perfectly....  thanks Timothy\n",
            "This is a really good simple watch. It tells the time and the date. What else would you want.<br /><br />Watch looks adventuresome, but not too much. Like the outdoorsy clothing line of the Gap. I like the strap for its feel and surprising durability.\n",
            "Extremely nice lookig watch. Skinny wrists will not support this watch. Received several nice complements the first time I wore it and was easily identified an an invicta watch.\n",
            "I bought this to use on my Basis Peak watch. I switched the pins from the Peak strap to this strap & it works just great! I'm very happy with my purchase & might decide to order in other colours!\n",

            "I wear this watch every day. I like it for is simple useful design. It is also very light weight. My favorite part of the design is the braded metal band. All in all a great watch for the money\n",

            "Yes like very much\n",

            "Please keep in mind, that when rating my DOM Watch with 5 Stars, it is a relatively new purchase of only a couple weeks. The main reason for my purchase is that not only the watch, but the band as well in made using Tungsten Carbide. I normally have to purchase a new watch every 6 to 12 months because of how worn and scratched the watch becomes. I purchased a wedding ring made of Tungsten Carbide from Amazon for the same reason. That was a year ago and there is not one scratch on the ring and it appears just like it looked when I purchased it. If this DOM Watch holds up as well as my ring has, I will be extremely happy with my decision. Happy Shopping! Kenny ~ Baton Rouge\n",

            "G-Shock by Casio, this must be the 6th one that I have and they are great. The Multi-band setting is great as I go overseas often and just set it for the city I'm visiting and I'm always on-time!<br />Casio quality is tops and the supplier had it to me in right on-time as well. I have an old numerical Casio that I bougth over 30 years ago and it still functions well, replaced the battery only 3-4 times - amazing.<br />Highly recommend this watch and Casio for someone looking for a watch that is not the size of an orange on your wrist, works great and can take a shock. Very satisfied.\n",

            "My husband loves his new watch.  He wears the watch out in the field, in daylight mostly but likes the illuminating hands when he has to be out in the dark. Was a little worried about the color but was true to the picture.  Looked out some really expensive watches but was worried as to how they would handle being in the field.  This watch has held up so far and was a great price.\n",

            "The crown and pushers screw down for water resistant.  Very heavy, band is made for someone with a large wrist but can be adjusted.  The crystal backing is a very interesting feature. The blue face isn't necessarily my preference but it works with the gold color of the case and band. The chronograph, day of the week dial, continuous second dial, accumulate minute dial all work flawlessly. The chronograph is capable of two types of time keeping. The names elude me but one mode simply accumulates time as you start and stop the timepiece, the other pauses the hand while the timepiece continues to keep time and then winds the hand to the current time once you un-pause the timepiece.\n",

            "A great watch from an outstanding seller!<br /><br />Of course, we all know that this is not a 2 tone Rolex Sub.  But at less than a HUNDRED BUCKS, it's an AUTOMATIC movement and that alone is worth the price.  It's a beautiful bracelet and of course, an iconic bezel and face.  Completely worth the price.  If you're like me, this is a cool piece at a great price point that will hold you over until you acquire your first pre-owned Rolie.\n",

            "Watch is more black than blue, but still very nice.\n",
            "this sucks\n",
            "it was a gift and deliver very fast. everything looks good and prefect. Thanks.\n",
            "For the price it's great, mine went about 10 minutes each day too fast, but that's better than being too slow. Also the band broke off but I just bought a new set from China for 2 bucks and I should be set for next time. (I expected the cheap band) It looks cool and steam-punk, just don't brag since up close it looks very fake. However most don't care much for it, but some like the look of it and point it out. It's discreet enough not to be distracting. I would wear this watch only on some occasions, but i did not use it everyday.\n",
            "Kids love there new alarm clocks and are getting up for school on there own.\n",
            "Received right on time. But not what I really wanted so I am going to return and get a better one.\n",
            "It was a gift for my daughter. She loves it. Good quality.\n",
            "Great watch but it dosnt last very long. I've had to buy this thing at least three times. The band keeps tearing\n",
            "Good product\n",
            "Excellent, thank you\n",
            "I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  The band is not very long.  It's too long to not wrap but too short to wrap almost 2 times.  The stripe with diamonds attached also are coming unglued.\n",
            "With 3 alarms, a timer that can be set beyond 1 hour, easy to push buttons, bright light.... The only thing I don't like is the Velcro band which can ruin some fabrics. No big deal, replaced with a buckle nylon band. Also nice the alarm is not as high pitched as typical digital watches.\n",
            "Nice watch\n",
            "Its so pretty .\n",
            "Perfect size for a woman's wrist. I have a complaint about the condition that it arrived. Usually watches come with a clear plastic cling cover on their faces and this one did not. And, there was no foam padding around the watch. Maybe Casio doesn't do this with their cheaper watches? Also, the framing around the face is scratched as if this were a returned unit being resold. Since I only paid $10, I guess I'll just leave it at - you get what you pay for but I'm not exactly happy. Not sure if this is an Amazon warehouse issue or a Casio issue.\n",
            "wear it every day\n",
            "Nice li'l wacth for early teeners. Have one myself!\n",
            "I just love this watch. Its my everyday watch. I always wanted a victorinox and i'm very pleased with this beauty. Its very heavy (witch i love) and the size is jut right. I will def buy more victorinox. HIGHLY recommended.\n",
            "Exactly what I was looking for\n",
            "Gorgeous watch ! Gorgeous packaging!\n",
            "Fantastic looking watch at a great price!\n",
            "Like the flywheel style bezel! For the price, I'm actually surprised the band is durable and still looks good. I get nervous about the metal quality of cheap watches but, in 6 months, this one has not tarnished. It's powered by kinetic movement and has to be reset it everyday after inactivity, so it's okay if it gets off by a few seconds. This isn't an aviator watch. Don't expect it to be the world's most accurate timepiece.\n",
            "This is a great watch, very nice color tone. It's simple and efficient, but also easy on the eye, but doesn't stand out too much. I bought this for my girlfriend as a basic watch to use everyday at work, and it's been great.\n",
            "It look good !!!!!!\n",
            "For the price. It was a good deal. I am satisfied. O.p south Philly.\n",
            "Great watch however, it's big for a woman. I bought it for my daughter and it was too big for her. It would be GREAT if it came in the companies LadyLine smaller watches.\n",
            "I love it\n",
            "Solid, reliable Timex watch.  Similar to the first watch I had roughly 25 years ago.\n",
            "Nice, Solid but not too heavy, Distinctive, would recommend.\n",
            "This watch looks nothing like the picture.  It's much smaller in size than depicted and it looks like tin instead of stainless steel.  I returned it.\n",
            "I first owned this watch about seven years ago and it worked great. As others have commented, it's nice to have a countdown and a traditional stopwatch feature. Display is easy to read. I lost the first watch and have ordered two replacements within the last year and both have had issues. The first one was not waterproof: after only wearing it swimming at the beach and also in the shower, the case began to fog up and eventually the watch conked out. Luckily, that watch was still under warranty. The replacement sent from Amazon, seems to be waterproof, but has the annoying habit of randomly resetting itself to the date &#34;Friday 1  1&#34; (year 2010) and the time to 12:00 am. NOT the quality that I expect from Casio. Too bad, this used to be my favorite watch! I'm beyond the warranty period so won't be able to get a replacement. Needless to say, I won't be ordering a new one.\n",
            "My husband loves this watch!  Just like the one he had before!\n",
            "Bought this watch as a gift for my father and he absolutely loves it.  Great product!\n",
            "Awesome in little words, very happy with it\n",
            "Wore it once for about 6 hours and had to reset the time four times! It was brand new! Looks nice though.\n",
            "Great watch for work, don't have to worry about getting it wet, it's a Timex!\n",
            "I purchased this watch for $14 and it shipped in about a day and arrived in two weeks. Impressed by the quality for such a low price. The strap takes time to break in and the winding dial is kind of loose. If you are looking for a watch to wear everyday this is NOT the watch to get. It looks great but will break if stressed too much, and is perfect for an elegant watch to wear at important events.\n",
            "I'm not happy with this watch.  The band's keeper straps is stretched and about to break already.  The numbers aren't as easy to read as I had hoped for counting heart beats with a stethoscope.  It's lack of a date make this watch less than ideal.  I wish I had bought something else.\n",
            "Great Watch. FYI, you need to read the instructions. Looks nice for the money.\n",
            "Works as advertised.\n",
            "Great looking watch! Love it! Will order another for my son...\n",
            "I have been searching for a slim, versatile, and good-looking watch for a long time now and I can't believe I was looking to spend a lot more money when I found the perfect watch for about $10 bucks!<br /><br />I have a smaller wrist and this watch just looks absolutely perfect.  I have a larger G-SHOCK but I just find it to be a bit awkward because it is much thicker.<br /><br />The strap on the F91W-1 is so thin and sleek that it wraps over my wrist with no ugly gaps.  Also, when I lay it down, it lays flat unlike the G-Shock which I have to set down sideways because the strap curls.<br /><br />The display of the F91W-1 gives me all the information I need and nothing more.  There are some displays that have annoying counters that just seem distracting; this watch does not.  I am very happy with this purchase and I wish I bought this watch sooner.<br /><br />The only thing that I can nitpick about is the fact that the light should be blue instead of green and it illuminates the left side stronger than the right.  Not a big deal but it would make the watch even better.<br /><br />Highly Recommend!!!\n",
            "Wrist band at pins broke within 2 months. Good watch, too good for cheap, shoddy craftmanship of plastic band. Not happt, save your money for better quality.\n",
            "Okay, I just got in the mail today and loved so much that I already had it sized at nearby watch store.  It is a beautiful timepiece that I plan to adore for years.  I was looking for a chunkier watch to wear with jeans and mostly black outfits.  This pic doesn't truly do it justice.  My wrist is a size 6 and the watch looks great.  Everything comes together just right!!!\n",
            "Decent watch. Great price. The crystal does scratch easy as other as have stated. I wear it when working outside so I don't damage my &#34;good&#34; watches\n",
            "Great deal, fast shipping\n",
            "I Like it a lot!!!\n",
            "Love this watch! So glad I purchased it. This particular watch could not be found in any local Michael Kors store, so I was a little nervous about purchasing it online. What a pleasant surprise when I opened the box. It's absolutely stunning... as pictured! I had to have 3 links taken out for a perfect fit. I am a satisfied customer!\n",
            "Real quiet motor that I never noticed moving at all.  Its seems like solid wood from its heavy weight.\n",
            "Nice buy, good value.  It is not a perfect fit for my LG watch.\n",
            "Good watch, kinda hard to set up. But you'll get the hang of it, it even tells the date!\n",
            "color is a bit light. darker brown would be more like original tag heuer band\n",
            "love the watch and works well\n",
            "The watch fits comfortably with a nice appeal to it as seen.\n",
            "Casual for every day use\n",
            "The clock is of good quality but not practical! It is very difficult to see the time and always have to turn on the backlight to see well. Disappointed .....\n",
            "Broke the first time I wore them!\n",
            "Looked much more plasticky in real life than in the pictures. Also a bit harder to see. I sent it back, but it is still an ok watch.\n",
            "As I had hoped, the watch is purple and black, not blue. I have small wrists, its slightly large, which I dont mind. The #'s are purple also. Im very happy.\n",
            "Fantastic...Until it stopped working...Ordered in August of 2015 the watch is dead by May 2016...<br />Not eligible for return. Yep, so, piece of crap...save your money.\n",
            "happy with purchase! beautiful watch\n",
            "This probably won't matter to most guys buying this band but, the shortest this band can be adjusted to is 5.5 inches.  On a large watch, this could make the total circumference 7.5&#34;<br />For all the skiny guys here, I wish all the sellers of these metal bands, would clearly indicate the smallest these bands are able to be adjusted to, in their description to avoid the guess work.\n",
            "The mesh braclet needs a better way to stay latched with the two sliders they don't hold the band\n",
            "This watch was a total waste of money.  The instructions are very vague so we couldnt even get it to do what it was supposed to and then soon after it quit working completely.  Even after charging for several hours, it will not even come on.  Horrible.\n",
            "beautiful watch. the first one fogged up in water but the second is working fine.\n",
            "Great Watch for the Money !\n",
            "It was advertised as having a &#34;Luminous Dial&#34;but this watch is not luminous<br />maybe it was at one time but not now VERY DISAPPOINTED !!\n",
            "Decent inexpensive watch for someone looking for this nice gold-tone and brown band combination. Initial problem with order was resolved very courteously and satisfactorily by seller.\n",
            "The velcro strap is very difficult to clean. It smells really bad after I wear it when sweating at all. I am looking for a replacement strap that is plastic or resin. I do not have sensitive skin but the strap is giving me a rash. The watch itself has been working fine so far, but I should add that this watch is not unisex, it is feminine looking. I have very small wrists for a female and the watch face is slightly bigger than I would like, but it is too small to look unisex on a man.\n",
            "The band is extremely stiff. I had to burn the holes for the clasp to catch. I think it will be an ok band, but if i did not have a torch and tools to fabricate a descent hole for the clasp this band is not worth the money.\n",
            "So far the watch is great.  It is a great looking watch.  The additional band is a nice touch.  I wish the face/dial was a little bigger, but I knew what I was getting.  I've seen the price for the watch at other places be much higher.<br /><br />UPDATE** I've had this watch for 2 years now and I'm still loving it! I wear this watch to work all of the time, and it still looks great.\n",
            "we ordered this band and it was so stiff, in exactly 10 days from purchase, the band snapped and is falling apart! 'Genuine leather'… really?\n",
            "Love my new watch.. beautiful and just what I wanted.\n",
            "It fits him great, looks cool, waterproof, and has a stopwatch too! It lights up and displays not only the time, but the calendar date and day of the week as well!\n",
            "So far so good. Looks good and appears to be very solid in regards to quality.\n",
            "Only watch I wear.  Love it\n",
            "Just exactly what I expected.  It also arrived earlier than designated dates.  Good product at a great price.\n",
            "A beautiful watch.  Well made, attractive, and looks good in either casual or dress settings.\n",
            "Thank you!\n",
            "This is my 2nd watch ... I replaced the first one I bought almost 15 years ago. The rubber part that attaches the watch to the band finally just fell apart.  The watch itself never has to be set, never has to have a battery change.  I'm pretty rough on my watches ... I owned a few G-Shock watches prior to this one and couldn't keep the band from breaking.  Never had trouble with this one.  Looking forward to another decade or two without any issues.\n",
            "I like it\n",
            "Display is not easy to read.  The color of the numbers is too dark compared to the background.  I am returning it.\n",

            "Great watch!! Very stylish\n",
            "Awesome Deal\n",
            "Great watch. It's a perfect size and hasn't let me down yet. The strap leaves something to be desired, but if you're looking for a reliable and unobtrusive watch, this is your choice. Being cheaper and attractive too is the icing on the cake.\n",
            "Love it and wear it every dat.\n",
            "Does not keep time well loses up to 40 minutes sometimes for no reason\n",
            "My boyfriend loved it!\n",
            "so cute and fits my wrist perfectly! love it!\n",
            "Loved the style of the watch! Can't beat the price either!\n",
            "This was perfect!\n",
            "I was just admiring the ProTrek on my wrist which I bought in 1995. It is not exactly the same as the model sold now, but most of the basics are the same. Solar charge battery obviously working 20 years later! Once every 3-4 years, I have had to adjust the time by a minute or two. The thing is indestructible, swims with me, is an old friend. No built-in obsolescence. Thanks, Casio!!!\n",
            "Like the elastic band, easy to don and doff for my kid. Recommended product.\n",
            "Pleased with item.\n",
            "pretty much every thing you need to repair your own watch and glasses too.\n",
            "My first titanium watch and I am very impressed. The weight makes this watch extremely comfortable on the wrist. The grayish tones both polished and brushed are extremely attractive. This is my first Oris although I just purchased the Aquis with rubber strap which is awesome. Overall the craftsmanship of the Oris seams to be top notch and the accuracy is within range for an automatic of this caliber. Very pleased with look and function of the watch at this time.\n",
            "Great looking watch for the price, the arms are kinda plastic looking but good product anyway\n",
            "I love this watch. I work in a fitness related field and am outdoors a ton. This is perfect! It does the necessary functions and is waterproof. Exactly what it said it would be.\n",
            "Awesome\n",
            "cool watch\n",
            "Nice watch, decent quality.  Cheap enough that if something happens to it, it really doesn't matter. Buttons are solid.  The display is easy to read.\n",
            "This Watch is incredible! It is in so much higher quality than the pictures and it's cheap as dirt. Even though it's U.S. Polo Ass. (Which kind of has a bad name to it) instead of just Polo, the fonts tiny and no one even notices and it's amazing. It has a beautiful leather strap and a shiny light brown plate behind the clock. It's WORTH YOUR MONEY ''\n",
            "I really like this watch! The case material says, stainless steel in the description, however, it is very light and doesn't feel like steel. If you have a large wrist, the band may be snug. The strap appears to have a leather or simulated lining. I cant tell which. Normally, I buckle the straps to the 5th hole, but in this one, I place it in the 4th one as the 5th is too tight. And my wrists are not large. The face, hands and numbers are easy to read and the watch keeps excellent time. The date numbers are hard to see in subdued lighting and the same is true of the bezel. Having said this, I am still quite happy with the watch and value. One never goes wrong with a SEIKO.\n",
            "very good product\n",
            "Thank you!\n",
            "LOOKS GREAT!!!! EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS WATCH IS CLASS....LOOKS RIGHT FOR BOTH CASUAL AND DRESS WEAR...\n",
            "It's a great watch. Fits nice, looks nice, lightweight, and accurate. My ONLY problem with the watch is how freaking loud the movement is. I can hear it across the room, I've gone so far to as keep it in another room when I sleep. While worn it can be heard. Another than that The 8184A is a fantastic watch.\n",
            "Looks great, works great. I love it...But then, I love the Green Bay Packers....\n",
            "i love the watch, but the description showing the box and warranty is misleading. After 2 orders, I am still waiting,\n",
            "I like the purple watch very much, my sister like the blue one, so happy!!\n",
            "Love this watch. I am a physician and have been wearing this watch for the last 15 years. Every time the battery goes out, I get a new one of the same kind. It keeps perfect time, gives me all the information I need like the time, seconds, date, day, month, and more. It is inexpensive and stylish at the same time. I recommend it anytime.\n",
            "I bought this watch on July 17 and today is Aug 26. So now I can't return it. It says its water proof, however, I went swimming in my pool and now it has water drops inside the glass.\n",
            "beautiful, quality watch !\n",
            "Excellent quality product. Very well built. Keeps time well. My only gripe, it is minor is that is very hard to see the tiny labeling in the bezel ie the inner black dial white numbers. I am 45 years old w average to good eyesight.  Again this complaint is minor!  If however you are maybe 60+ years of age I recommend the Citizen Nighthawk flight watch thst has bigger writing easier to see. Though do note , bigger writing means less functions. This Seiko has way more functionality. So is a trade off, more functions smaller writing or larger writing less function. Quality and sturdiness of this watch is unparalleled. Seiko nailed it right on this one!\n",
            "Strap was broken upon opening of box. Poor quality timepiece. Looks good but is not of good stock.\n",
            "I am sorry but this watch is very confusing to set. Even my husband who is a scientist could not get the date to work. Then, when I tried, I got the time but not the date. Plus, to start the clock for a work out it wasn't responding. Perhaps it was us. I returned it because I want something easy.\n",
            "Just perfect for my watch. Great !!!\n",
            "I love my watch and so does other ppl!!!\n",
            "love it, and so far so good\n",
            "watch was fine but the manual was only in Chinese. I returned it.  The good review you may see was mistakenly given it was actuall for the replacement watch . Similar but not the same . This time with manual in enlish.\n",
            "Excellent, thank you\n",
            "Bought it for my wife for her birthday - well, actually she picked it out.  She is pleased, the dial is big enough so that it is easily visible but not too &#34;mannish&#34; according to her.  It shipped on time, arrived in good condition,  and we are both pleased.  What more can one say.\n",
            "I did not recieve the way he sin the photo .. I expectates the dial to be gold with diamonds in the picture and they also look like girl watches\n",

            "Look very closely at the roman numeral four in the picture.  I received a broken watch.  When I contacted the manufacturer they sent me another broken watch.  I still wear it even though it doesn't run.  It is attractive and the band is supple.\n",
            "I have purchased similar bands from a variety of places -- and this one is the flimsiest of them all.  In particular, the center metal strap that goes through the watch band hole is not very strong.  It goes under the metal from that it is supposed to sit upon.\n",
            "Very casual, fit me perfectly.\n",
            "I love the Betsy Johnson Watches !! Got this one for my daughter to go college with...she loves it and gets so many compliments on it !! It really is beautiful. Very happy with this watch.\n",
            "This watch Looks not like it's $75, but more like $750! The gold finished band and the black face go together perfectly for a fantastic contrast that is sure to make you stand out in a crowd. I'd say it's pretty high quality too for being below $100! Good buy I'd recommend it.\n",
            "this is sooo cute I have a really thin wrist so it feels a lil loose..but the color is gorgeous\n",

            "Exellent\n",
            "Not very water resistant, and breaks quickly. But if you use and abuse your watches like I do its a good choice because you don't want to spend money on a good one for it to break too.\n",

            "this is a great deal for an inexpensive watch.has analog and digital reading.fits great,looks very nice.is not bulky for a large dial watch.i would highly recommend this watch. I wear it everyday and so far it has been great\n",

            "Velcro is okay. All I can say is that it came off in the river the first day. Nice watch, nice features, nice look, user-friendly. I'd by it again, but I would use a rubber band if I took it back to the river.\n",
            "Nice\n",
            "Band very small in length would only fit a very very slim wrist.  Wrong description on site, band width is 16mm not 18mm.  I ordered a new band according to the description given on site and when the new band arrived it was too big.  I wasted my money.\n",
            "Loved how the watch fits. Very comfotable but a month after getting it, it quit working.\n",
            "Awesome and unique watch! Please don't let these negative reviews pursued you.. I bought this watch for my 12 year old son who figured out how to set the watch within a few minutes WITHOUT having to go online for the instructions.. On the top corners of the watch there are invisible buttons you use go set to your correct time.\n",

            "This is a fantastic watch for the price!\n",
            "cant set the time\n",
            "Feels cheap even for a $20 watch. Has bouts of working then not working despite being a month old. Needs constant resetting.\n",
            "Really nice watch for a reasonable price.\n",
            "This watchband reminds me of horseshoes being tossed, twelve pack boxes of sale beer stood up on one end, and pickup trucks with bench seats that smell of burning oil and gas.<br /><br />I wear it everyday like a boss. It's vintage because it doesn't need to be improved, much like a double-edged razor.\n",
            "Good watch so far. Easy to set/adjust. Display is plenty visible. Not sure why so many people whine about not being able to read it\n",
            "Good\n",
            "I got this watch for refing soccer games.  It's fairly shock proof and the readouts are large so I don't necessarily have to have glasses on.  The strap is fabric so sweating isn't a problem.  Decent price.  Good watch.\n",
            "My daughter is a cross country runner and loves it\n",
            "Gorgeous watch with lots of history.  Looks good on the wrist and cannot wait to read up on it.  A legend.\n",
            "Beatifull watch, the product is according with the description, I do not give the 5 stars due to the battery was dead.\n",
            "My husband surprised me with this watch for our anniversary, and I was thrilled!  It's not only elegant and beautiful, it was easy to set, and it keeps great time.\n",

            "Very good quality product.. I order 2 model and one for my brother in love.\n",
            "OK product, very light and feels cheap. But considering the figure costs over $3 each at the store, I think it is just OK.\n",
            "Cool watch. Works great.\n",
            "This watch band is rubbish, I lost my brand new g shock surfing, don't buy this Chinese watchband, the velcro and strap for watch is not good quality, I am amazed that so many people are saying they like it, must be the Chinese manufacturer giving it high ratings!\n",
            "Love this watch. Beautiful craftsmanship and details. Came packaged very well with productive tape on watch glass. Not overly heavy but feels substantial. Great because I cannot see up close and the face is perfect with or without my readers. Love the tortoise band. So many compliments o his watch, I am almost afraid to say where it was purchased!\n",
            "nice product\n",
            "Great watch, offers both military time & regular 12/12 hour day times, and has an alarm.<br /><br />Minus 1 star because i wasn't expecting it to be small, and the light button is decent. But those don't affect the performance of the watch, still a good buy.\n",
            "I bought this watch just a few months ago, and while I think it's a decent buy for the experience/price & value.  What I did not expect was that the ceramic bezel GMT ring just fell off suddenly as I was just casually wearing the watch.  Note:  I wear this watch 1-2 days a week thus very low risk of wear/tear.  I never found the bezel ring and now the watch is pretty much garbage (see photo).  I can't believe it was simply glued on.  Huge disappointment.  Thus, the poor rating I've given to Parnis.  I would not recommend anyone buying a Parnis watch.\n",
            "I loved this item excellent customer service.  It was too big for my son.  He was really sad it didn't come smaller.  Other than that excellent quality.  VERY impressed.\n",
            "excelente\n",
            "Simple basic watch.  Fairly comfortable.  Numbers easy to read for my old eyes.\n",
            "I initially ordered a watch back in May and it arrived promptly, packaged well, with a nice note explaining the product and how many hours of battery life it has. I was thrilled with it! Since I've used that watch extensively, and since I am not taking the test until October, I decided to order two additional watches should my initial one run out of battery in the interim. They both just arrived--turned on!--and the knob on one of them is broken so I can't turn it off. The packaging was terrible and there was no note about the product or even a packing slip. Needless to say, I am not happy that I'll have to take the time to return the broken product and I'm also not happy that the other watch may have been left turned on for weeks for all I know. Who knows when the battery life on that one will die as a result.\n",
            "Very nice watch and a great deal. Just know that you will probably have to get it linked down.\n",
            "This is the biggest watch face I have ever seen. And bought the watch for my son thinking being 'Unisex' it would be on the smaller to medium size. -- WOW!! This thing is ginormous!! Anyhow, not a good choice for mortals.\n",
            "Have owned this watch for about a month now, and can say I've found it to be a really nice dress chronograph for a good value.  Was concerned that at 42 mm it might wear too large on my smallish wrists, but have been happy with the fit.  My only wish is that Orient would have used a sapphire crystal instead of mineral to prevent scratching, but I knew that when I purchased and so far, so good as far as scratches go.\n",
            "Excelent!!\n",
            "Ok\n",
            "I love this watch so much, but the watchband is too long for me and I need to go to other place to adjust it.\n",

            "Excelent\n",
            "Watch is exactly like photo! Super fast shipping!!! Very happy with my purchase!!\n",
            "Another rugged Invicta.  Built with quality in mind.  Simple watch in that all it has is a second hand and date window in addition to regular analog time keeping.  Great for water use, large good looking watch.  Came with all paper.  Very easy to set.\n",
            "Okay watch, not very satisfied with quality of wristband\n",
            "This watch didn't work.\n",
            "This watch is more beautiful than the picture shows. I love it and have gotten compliments on it despite only owning it a few days. would definitely recommend it.\n",
            "The watch works but the band is fixed in size and much larger than my wrist.\n",
            "Awesome\n",
            "I like its simple, classic design, but it seemed low quality.  The date dial was stuck between two dates.  I had to return it because the band was irritating my skin.\n",
            "Fast shipping!<br />It looks awesome! I had so many good complements.\n",
            "A necessary tool for those who change/replace watch batteries.  Well made, the two sizes are great as is the protective cover.  I was finally able to open the back of a watch I haven't been able to for the longest time.  This tool will help you from scratching the back of your watch in the process of opening by lodging firmly into the back edge.  Highly recommend.\n",
            "The Casio Model DQ-750F Digital Alarm Clock is a great product with large clock digits (~1.2 inches/31mm height) and a beautiful blue/green electro-luminescent (EL) backlight.  It has simple controls that are very easy to set the time & alarm without reading the included manual and uses AA x2 batteries.  The alarm beep is loud enough without being too annoying.  I anticipate them to last at least 20 years like my previous Casio alarm clock that I finally had to replace since I wore out the setup switch since I constantly change my wake up time for weekday/weekend.  It is made in China like so many things. My initial delivery of two clocks were both defective with missing LCD segments.  Vendor was prompt to send out two replacement items which seem to be defect free so far. I would buy from Watchtonics via Amazon again.  Thanks to all involved!\n",
            "Very nice watch.  Well made.  My main use of this watch is time and date. The digital  numbers even see better in the sun.  It's bluetooh. Haah who care. I love it and wear it for the weekend play time.\n",
            "Very good\n",
            "Love this watch. I am in love with the mesh watch band and I wear this on every occasion that I have. The only thing I didn't like was the glass that covers the watch as it isn't very clear and it reflects any light and its a bit foggy, other than that I love this watch.\n",
            "Fine\n",
            "This watch is HUGE, I thought it was a woman's style that you can wear as a necklace, this is as large a man's pocket watch. But it has held up fine, the case is a little lightweight, but you do get what you pay for.\n",
            "I ran with it, sweat in it, showered in it, and slept with it on for over a month and still looks as good as the day I got it. Expect nothing less from G-Shock.\n",
            "I got one of these 15 years ago.  It runs great and look as good as it did the day it was new.  The watch has a classic look that (in my opinion) never goes out of style.  If you are looking at these, I'm sure you work hard.  Treat yourself to something nice.\n",
            "Keeps excellent time.\n",
            "HARD TO SET, AND VERY BULKY AND STIFF.  VERY VERY LARGE.\n",
            "Good looking watch but loses about 5 minutes over the course of 2 weeks. Constantly having to fix it.\n",
            "Very nice watch, my third and favorite Invicta. Very high quality, keeps time okay, I have to wind and set it everyday.\n",

            "great quality watch\n",
            "Love it but was way to big.\n",
            "I love this watch! It's a little smaller than expected, but a great buy. The mesh strap is surprisingly comfortable. It looks black in the photo, but it's really more of a dark grey.\n",
            "Nice for the price\n",
            "I love it coz it matches the watch I got my boyfriend for Valentine's day.\n",
            "Returned. Great looking watch but not what I was looking for!\n",
            "Needed a classy 17mm band that was short enough for a woman.  Almost impossible to find, so I'm very pleased with the fit and the look.\n",
            "Just got it and - so far - I'm happy!\n",
            "Simple calculator watch.  These have been in production for over a decade.  I remember I always wanted one when I was in middle school.  It is truly water resistant.\n",
            "The watch band is an exact replacement for original. It is durable comfortable. The band also arrived earlier then expected from supplier.\n",
            "No good, wrist band broke first time I wore it\n",
            "Love it\n",
            "it looks good\n",
            "Okay good illumination wristba ds is small\n",
            "BULKY... this is a bulky watch with a bunch of fake features.  My 11 year old was not impressed but it has functioned well.\n",
            "Nice watch.  Looks great with either suits or causal\n",
            "Amazing watch. Cheap. But build great. Ive worn it everyday for about a year.\n",
            "Nice\n",
            "Good quality\n",
            "Like the size and color\n",
            "A great inexpensive nice watch to wear to the pool, beach, baseball game, or any place you need to know the time with something that will not fall apart. I bought this watch specifically to wear on vacation wherever I will be around water, and it has not let me down. The band is comfortable, and it really is a sharp looking watch. And you get the Casio quality. The battery is still strong, and it keeps great time. I hope this review has been helpful to you.\n",
            "This is the perfect alarm clock. I bought exactly this one 20 years ago and it finally died. I could not believe my eyes to see that exactly the same model was still available. Hopefully it will still be available in another 20 years when this one dies!\n",
            "PERFECT!<br />Was exactly what I was looking for and my son absolutely loves it.\n",
            "This watch and look nice but didn't hold up well at all.  First the loops that hold the end of the band broke, then the band itself tore where it's buckled. All within a year.\n",
            "Love it!\n",
            "Keeps time but the ticking is VERY LOUD\n",
            "Simple design, but very elegant and classy. Will go with basically anything! Large and oversized, without looking masculine, which is just what I was looking for.\n",
            "I like it because it is very easy to use and care.\n",
            "Excellent kids watch. Bought this for my 6 year old neice who rarely takes it off. The watch band is durable and the glass watch face has withstood numerous impacts. The watch fits her wrist comfortably and the chrome accents show no wear even after 8 months. Highly recommended.\n",
            "i like it, however it was never mentioned that this watch can not be &#34;sized&#34; by anyone other than a &#34;TAG&#34; distributor.  I think this is rediculousl  I purchased on line because I have no time to &#34;shop&#34; yet now I have to &#34;drive.  Now I have to take 3 hours out of my day to go to closest TAG dealer.  Not happy with that\n",
            "An excellent smart watch, my only complaint is that you have to make a very obvious &#34;look at my watch&#34; gesture to get the time to display.\n",
            "directves on how to used it\n",
            "Cute. Definitely for small wrist. It has 2 snaps. I wear it on the first snap. Cheap but keeps time , and looks good!\n",
            "I'm very pleased with this product. I needed to replace the band on a Casio Men's SGW300HB-3AVCF Multi-Function Sport Watch. It has all the features I need for heading into the back country. This band is perfect for it, it looks as if it will hold up as well as the watch has. I really like the velcro closure. It gives me the perfect fit.\n",
            "A very nice looking watch that keeps very good time.\n",
            "The watch hands all caught on each other. The seconds hand moved 4 times faster than it was supposed to and the watch started and stopped (mostly stopped) at random. Very poor quality. Very disappointed. I wasn't expecting a $700 watch quality but for $60 I should be able to expect it to work.\n",
            "Pretty but band hinge broke with not much resistance from my handbag on my arm which was NOT heavy, at all. Must take to a jeweler now to have fixed!\n",
            "Works perfectly!  I was able to remove the watch backs/battery covers using these 2 tools.  I was not able to remove them before these tools arrived.  Works as advertised &;easy to use.  Feels &#34;good&#34; in my hands, as well.  I'm very glad I purchased these.  Save yourself grief, damage & $$$ & order these tools.\n",
            "kind of long, i had to make my own hole for it to fit on my wrist, but i have pretty skinny wrists so this always happens. Good material, nice and soft but hasnt cracked or torn\n",
            "Two thumbs way up!\n",
            "For the price, a very nice watch.  It runs about a minute fast after about 3 months.  Otherwise, I've been very pleased!\n",

            "Beautiful!  Perfect! Looks like an expensive watchband.  It exceeded my expectations.\n",
            "I love the face of this watch very much.  I get compliments often.  I am not a big fan of the band, though many compliment that, too.  I do like that you can adjust it anywhere due to the design.  Its just a bit scratchy on me.  Other than that.  its great!\n",
            "Clockwork Synergy silicone bands are excellent. Period.<br /><br />Bought two silicone bands for a new watch. The new watch came with a very nice leather band, but leather absorbs sweat - bad consequences follow. Silicone is easy to clean with an alcohol wipe. Not only that, but these bands by Clockwork Synergy are very flexible and comfortable. Additionally, they come with quick-change pins already installed, making it easy to install or remove to give your watch another look.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't love is the shade of green. I would have preferred a darker green or camo (Clockwork Synergy, are you listening?) in the 24mm size band. Well, I knew what I was getting when I ordered it. The other band I bought? Stiff as a board and uncomfortable! Didn't come with pins, much less quick-change pins! This band is excellent and I recommend it with five stars.\n",
            "I like the look and size of the watch.  it is very clear and easy to see the time.  The date is practically  impossible to see - but that doesn't bother me.  My issue is with the bezel.  It sticks when wet. So underwater it is useless.  Clearly for a diver, especially when wanting to rotate the bezel and use it for a safety stop countdown, it is unacceptable.\n",
            "invicta watches are very good for the price here. I would not hesitate to buy again. Good vendor and product.\n",
            "Admittedly, I normally don't wear a watch. Even comfortable watches seem to be an annoyance on the wrist, so I'd carry my watch in my suit pocket... back when I wore suits. Nowadays, I'd check the time on my cell phone... but, of course, in New Mexico you can get out of cell phone range, so... when Vine offered me this Armitron watch I decided to re-visit the days of my youth, when I did wear one.<br /><br />Overall, I am quite pleased. It has a \\\\\"good feel\\\\\" on the wrist, though I note other reviews that complain about the wrist-band. It seems to work fine for me. The main plus is an attractive dial face, with blue background. Since it is an analog dial (and weren't they all, in one's youth), and large enough, it is easy to read the time, even with aging eyes. And that's that... it is a watch, and not an airplane, with lots of features that won't be used.<br /><br />The only drawback that I (can't) see (well) is the date, day of the week feature, which is too small. But a larger feature might detract from its overall attractiveness. So, if you don't reference the date feature much, as I do not, that should not be a drawback. Though it is unlikely anyone would use it as a dive watch (you do need some other features when you do that), it is rated water-proof to 99 ft.<br /><br />Overall, for utility and price, I'd give it 5-stars.\n",
            "A simple and reliable watch. Geat look.\n",
            "Worked and fit. Llike\n",
            "Excellent, thank you\n",
            "Very nice watch for the price. I love the blue accents. The clasp is a bit different then what I'm use to as it's hidden to make the band look seamless, but it works fine so far. Nice weight and feel... it's a pretty big watch.<br /><br />This watch offers the ability to monitor three different time zones... switching between the first and second with one of the knobs, and the third with the dial around the face of the watch.<br /><br />Overall, works great, looks great, no complaints...\n",
            "Best digital watch ever. I am a 40 year old engineer, scuba diver and mountaineering fun. I have Casio's, citizens, Suunto's, Nike's, Timex's and Polar watches but definitely this one has all the features I always wanted in a watch. Solar powered...that's amazing. Fiber carbon strap, 4 alarms, stopwatch start feature with a one button activation....great!!!!!!!! Altimeter, compass...etc. The negative display makes it a different digital watch. If you can afford it...go ahead. My first watch was a Casio 34 years back...and I think this one will be my last. Expensive...but you get what you pay for. Very satisfied !\n",
            "A little heavier than I was expecting, but otherwise, it's a great watch.\n",
            "It appears to have a rotating bevel; it does not.  Larger than I expected.  Nice quality, as expected from Seiko.  Disappointed that the rotating bevel does not rotate (I like to time things easily with a bevel.)\n",
            "Very nice watch! It seems really a rock bracelet so i like it very much!<br />All ok and perfect at the deliver\n",
            "Already in my invicta watch silicon band\n",
            "My son loved it, and one year later when the strap broke, he loved it so much that we ordered another one. Fixed the strap with super glue and his sister wears the old one - even though it's not a girly watch because she loves it that much as well. They really like being asked What Day is it? What time is it? And timing everything with the stop watch.\n",
            "Good watch, buttons are to difficult to press as others have stated. However it is the thinnest G-Shock available at the time so I have decided to live with the button issue.\n",
            "I'm very pleased with this watch so far. It's a nice weight and looks good. I've only had it for a couple of days but so far, so good.\n",
            "I never had a watch winder but this one is so quiet and works perfectly.  Finally my watch is always on the correct time.\n",
            "this was awful!! to big and looked cheap! DO NOT BUY\n",
            "Purchased this product for my Son for Christmas. It looked great, but that is were it ended. I paid twice the current $40 price, what a scam these people are... Had problem with the minute hand touching the second hand, so watch does not work because the hands lock up. They want another $28 just to look at it and several weeks to &#34;fix&#34; it.<br /><br />Any watch that can go for a $400 retail price down to $40 is a piece of junk. I will never buy another Invicta product again. EVER! Would have been better off getting a knock-off at Walmart since QUALITY does NOT seem to be part of their owner/customer experience.\n",
            "returned it for better quality\n",
            "Perfect product! Nice price! Fast delivery!\n",
            "Chain broke almost immediately. Decided not to fuss with a return and just bought a new chain. Then clasp inside that holds the door shut wouldn't do its job. Horrible. Heart broken son. Really wanted a pocket watch. Shame!\n",
            "They instructions are very hard to understand\n",

            "Update: Im a nurse and I love this watch! I bought it in August of 2015 and it's going strong. It's easy to wash and takes a beating. I'm back for another one in case they ever stop making them. Buy this watch!  I went back and forth before ordering this watch for my nursing job. Ive always used Timex but I thought I might go a different way this time. This watch works, is waterproof and the material looks rugged. I have high hopes. Also, orange makes me happy so I love the color!\n",
            "I am extremely happy I bout this for my watch. It feels nice and looks very professional but sporty at the same time. I am only upset that after I put it on, the second foldable piece on the bottom does not close all the way, so I find myself continuously reclosing it. Its not too big of a problem, but I wish it was constructed a little better.\n",
            "Ordered this and absolutely love it!\n",
            "Nice watch.\n",
            "Nice Lego clock, but the time looks foggy. You can see it... Just foggy.\n",
            "If you're tall, you might want to think twice before buying this watch. It is VERY small and light -- more like a kid's. I'm 6'3&#34;, and right now I don't know whether I'll keep it or try to resell it to get back some of the money. It's pity, because the design is really cool, and it seems to work all right. I'd be really happy with it, if it were as big as it seems on Amazon.\n",
            "Good looking watch but digital readout hard to read unless your in direct light. analog time hard to read too because it gets lost in the design or color of the background and at night the backlight isn't so great. Scrolling through the menu options not so easy or intuitive.\n",
            "The watch is excellent the only downside is that I have trouble getting the day of the week which is only a minor downside but other then that I enjoy this product\n",
            "Pretty watch.  Love the colors.  Arrived in good condition and it runs.\n",

            "I get lots of compliments and it was packaged beautifully! Great for summer :) The only thing is that I have small wrists so this watch dances a little on my wrist but I don't mind.\n",
            "Authentically made in Japan.  Nice marriage of orange, yellow, gold and black.  A real eye catcher as production of these watches have stopped so these are now rare finds!\n",
            "It was a gift for my brother and he loved it!\n",
            "Delivered a day early to my front door. Looks like a $200.00 watch. Works great and keeps perfect time. I never get my watches wet. Just love the look of a Divers watch. Can't go wrong at that price. Stuhrling Original rocks!\n",

            "I've had various makes of Timex Ironman watches in the past, so when my last watch was lost, I chose to replace it with the same brand.<br />Two weeks into wearing it (bought July 17, occurred on July 31), I was river tubing and the &#34;WR 100M&#34; as specified on the face on the watch fogged up. I need this watch for work and it took four days in the sun for the fogged screen to dry. Once it did, the indiglo lit up with nice and then shorted out. The light hasn't worked since. I work night shift as a nurse and need to light up the screen to read the second hand.<br /><br />I now have to get another watch and am wary of this brand.\n",
            "it broke right away\n",
            "Used this twice the day I got it. First watch I removed a pin to add a link and it was smooth sailing. The second watch had a wider pin that was placed more tightly and while the tool was able to get the pin out about 40% of the way, I had to pull the rest of the pin out with needle nose pliers. Would have been nice if the pin attachment was a little longer. Still, it works great and both watches were adjusted.\n",
            "it's a beautiful watch, but unfortunately I had a bad experience with the carrier, first time my items got sent by i-parcel, and arrived about a week later, it's a big deal to trying to track it down.. Well, good quality and great watch, bad carrier.\n",
            "the packaging is impressive, with the large colored box.the watch comes well protected with a plastic film so that the watch arrives in immaculate state.<br />this watch is very practical, I like the design and attention to detail and the refined features, soft supple rubber is comfortable to the wrist, the rotating dial mechanism feels solid and it has the right amount of friction. the only thing I dont like is that the screw on knob seems very thin when you unscrew it to set the time and start the watch.I feel like I have to turn the know carefully. But once I set the time and date, I screw it back on in place and it sits solidly in place, I have only taken it in the pool so far and no problem, hope to take it into the sea for snorkling before the end of summer, if it fails I will be back. so far it looks and works great.\n",
            "Does exactly what I needed it to do. Holds watches securely without marring the case. I use it whenever I need to change batteries on either mine or my wife's Tag Huer watches.\n",
            "I am returning it because the band is extremely large other than that it was a fine looking watch\n",
            "cant set the time\n",
            "This is a beautiful watch but it has a major flaw so I'll discuss the negative first...and this pertains to the brown watch only.  The face is very difficult to read.  If you are buying a watch for functionality, you might want to pass on this watch.  The problem is that there is not enough of a contrast in color.  If you notice how dark the lower part of the watch is in the picture, that illustrates how you must view it at the perfect angle to actually see the details of the watch.  Even under bright lights in the office, you have to angle it perfectly to enjoy its beauty.  Beyond that, it is a great watch.  I have several watches under $100 and this feels like a much much more expensive watch...even for a quartz. The quality, from the packaging to the band to the watch itself, makes this an excellent value.  But for you watch snobs...my statement is based on the &#34;feel&#34; of materials, design and etc.  I'm not an expert on the various movements and crystals to determine the quality of the nuts and bolts of the watch.  Another thing to consider is that it is also pretty large but I happen to like larger watches.  I love the 24mm band that fits the larger face.  If it wasn't so difficult to read the face, I would rate this a 5+.  So will you get compliments if you wear the watch????  That depends on where the person is standing when he/she sees your watch.\n",

The band was stiff & the holes for the buckle very tight. The loop to keep the excess band from getting caught seems to be on the loose side & I feel it may come off ( this is a problem I have & will probably always have ).\n",

It was somewhat easy to sync to my smart phone.  I read the other reviews and they help me to figure out which app to load on my phone.  I did receive the order in a timely manner and it was packaged quite well.  Only gave the item two stars because it stopped working, after a few hours of usage.\n",

            "This watch is more than I expected! I had a Casio Pathfinder for a few years which I loved, inadvertently smashed the face on the corner of a piece of stone.  When I saw this watch I knew it was the next step up and love the features, yet the surprising factor is the details of the watch.  The performance is as expected, been swimming etc...no issues.  Like I said it's the look and details that were the seller for me?\n",

            "The shipping came in very quick. I was worried about the &#34;woman's band length&#34; as it does not say but I ordered it anyways. It came in and I fell in love. The watch is perfect! Thin, not ridiculously large, the band is amazing material and it most importantly, it fits! Great watch, great seller!\n",

            "Love the watch.\n",
            "I LOVE THIS WATCH! The pattern is even cooler when you have it in-hand. There's an orange color in there that comes out more and makes it look pretty cool. Otherwise, it's as pictured on the site. The seller was great. This was an effortless transaction! Thank yoU!\n",
            "Excellent appearance and sale price.\n",
            "Yes it fits the watch and works, but it is not a true replacement. It is finished on only one side (the original is finished on both), is about half the thickness of the original, and looks &#34;cheaper.&#34; I would say not worth more than $10. Last time my band wore out I shipped it to Skagen repair and they treated it as a free warranty fix. You can now buy original quality replacement from factory, much better.\n",
            "Band was what I expected. Meshed my skinny wrist to a big watch. Inexpensive but quality ok & clasp seems fine.\n",

            "I had my eye on this watch around Christmas time of 2014 as I had received a number of Amazon gift cards. A few of the Negative reviews dissuaded me from buying however it remained on my wish list. Low and Behold last week I gave in an purchased a used watch from a wholesaler, for the great price of 19.99, thank God I did not spend a penny more.  The watch arrived promptly and with no delay and is packaged in a  comically large box which if it had not been bent would have looked handsome, all be it huge on my dresser. The watch itself needs a huge box because it is giant! the circumference is so large that it looks like a small wall clock on my wrist. This however is my own fault for not paying closer attention to the measurements. To the watch build itself:<br />1. The watch looks quality from afar, however is extremely cheep. It feels like it is made of plastic and the only actual metal on it is the backing.<br />2. The Crown and dials feel like they might fall off at any minute<br />3. The studs in the leather band are for looks only the band is actually glued and also feel like they might pop right off if I decide to give a random high five<br />4. The &#34;Genuine Leather Band&#34; is already flaking after one day of wear.<br />I could go on and on about how disappointed I am in this watch, however I will simply say, save your money and invest in real watch from an established brand you trust because this one feels like it came out of a gum ball machine.\n",
            "Amazing it's just my expectation\n",
            "Just great...our two year old Grandson loves it !!\n",
            "I love the watch<br />  It is easy to read in water aerobics.\n",
            "Good looking watch and is very comfortable. Beware, if you actually use it and and submerge it underwater.....it will fail. Not as durable as I would expect a Columbia product to be.\n",
            "I had to return the goods because I could not understand the handbook which came withe watch.  It was in Japanese.  I do not read Japanese.\n",
            "Quite elegant.  Though I plan on getting a real alligator band.  Can't beat the price.\n",
            "Great watch for the price.\n",
            "I love this watch and have used several of them over the last ten years. The watches have lasted, but not so the wristbands. They wear out and break after a couple of years. The cost to replace them is about the same or more than the price of a new watch. You need to change this!\n",
            "Very nice watch. Great size. Fits comfortably on your wrist and looks stylish and sophisticated. If you are not accustomed to butterfly clasp watches it may be initially confusing how to adjust but easy enough to soon figure out.\n",
            "This is a pretty good watch. Everything works as it should, and it is simple to operate. The movement is precise and smooth. The downside is the finish is slightly less than what I was expecting and the leather band gets really dirty really easily, and there is no good way to clean it. I've only had it for about a month, but so far I am happy.  Update: strap broke within a month.\n",
            "Excellent watchband and great value.\n",
            "I love the product!!!\n",
            "I'm very happy with this buy!! It's pretty simple to use and set up, even without the manual... I should probably read it though and see if I can adjust the size because it's a bit too big for my wrist(since it's a men's watch). But other than that, I love it! There's even an alarm, like wow haha I didn't expect that at all... AND A TIMER. Talk about a pleasant surprise!\n",
            "So far the watch is comfortable and looks nice. My only complaint is that the watch is always slow. I need to check the battery in it.<br /><br />Edit 10/02/15<br />The watch is broken will not keep time. I bought a lemon don't be like me.\n",
            "Very Nice!\n",
            "This is very dressy. I can hardly wait to wear it\n",
            "excelente\n",
            "They are great little time pieces. I've given my pink face to my daughter. I don't know if I can part with anymore. Casio is a very reliable watch. Plus being affordable for anyone.\n",
            "This watch is superb.  I was in the market for a quality automatic to replace the 30 year old Seiko 5 that I've been wearing forever.  To be honest the old watch with the 7002 movement is still working like a champ but it needs a new crystal.  Turns out I could buy this complete watch for about the cost of repairing the old one.  I was leaning towards a brand under the Swatch group with an ETA movement in the $500 price range until I found this gem.  Pros: Excellent look and layout of the dial.  Everything is simple, easy to read, and looks classy in my opinion. The lume actually WORKS in the dark for a while! Keeps excellent time.  I'm tracking this very closely and I'm at about -1 or -2 seconds a day give or take.  My watch is WELL within COSC standards.  After a two week period I'm running twenty seconds slow. There are Rolex watches that don't keep time as well.  I could possibly adjust to get the accuracy even better but I figure that if it isn't broke I'm not going to fix it until it is. Great fit and finish.  The $185 MSRP is actually a fair price.  The fact that this watch+shipping is less than $60 makes this watch a fantastic value! Easy to set and &#34;hack&#34;.  This is a non hackable movement BUT if you pull the crown and gently apply very light pressure as to make the minute hand almost turn counter clockwise the second hand will stop allowing you to hack with GPS time.  Cons: Band sucks.  That's it.  It's a matter of preference but I prefer a quality leather band over a nylon or canvas weave band.  It's not a comfort or look issue for me, it's a stink issue.  I wear this watch all the time and during a workout sweat goes in, does not come out.  After a week or so it starts to reek enough to make a maggot puke and knock a buzzard off a gut truck.  Easy fix and cheap however the supplied band IS actually nice and well finished.  If you don't mind a weave band the OEM band will work just peachy fine.  UPDATE:  This watch lasted me 4 days shy of a year before it died.  The rotor came loose from the movement.  It may be a quick cheap fix?  I hope so.  I'd like to wear this watch for a lot longer.  I replaced it with a very similar looking, but solar powered, SNE179 &#34;Railroad Approved&#34; piece until I can get it fixed.\n",
            "great value and excellent product\n",
            "Excellent if the band doesn't fade.\n",
            "THSIS WATCH IS HARD TO SET AND VERYD LARGE AND BULKY.  I GAVE IT TO MY NURSE\n",
            "I'm very pleased with the watch and delivery. Thank you.\n",
            "What can I say about this watch? I own many other watches. Some very expensive in the tens of thousands and this SKMEI is simply impressive. It is more practical and useful than most my other watches I own. It looks good too. Might feel cheap if you grab it in your hand but looks great in your wrist. I am taking it with me when i go traveling.\n",

            "I bought this watch for my brother's 40th birthday. He is an avid outdoor-kind-of-guy, so I knew camo was the right choice.<br />He loves it! It is sturdy, and very well made. He wears it all the time. The camo pattern is muted, so it works even when dressed up. I may order one for my husband next.\n",
            "On time every day and looks great when worn out on the town.\n",
            "The watch is everything I wanted. Nice easy to read large face and very attractive. The only negative is a somewhat stiff band but it looks great\n",

            "Great deal.\n",
            "Given its price, I was shocked at the quality of the strap I received. I was hesitant to buy this because of how few reviews were available describing the product. I'm glad I took the chance!<br /><br />The leather is thick and substantial. The feel is smooth and soft to the touch. I was not expecting that at all. Comparing the color of the leather in the photo to what I received. I would say the color is a bit more mixed and lighter in some areas of the leather. The color is somewhere between the underside color in the photo and the top. Regardless the band is still handsome. The mixed color is a sign that the leather is real, because it's skin and there's variation.<br /><br />Keep in mind that because the leather is nice and thick depending on the thickness of watch pins it may be a tight fit. As well as because it is soft it will get marked up eventually adding character to the band.<br /><br />I've bought numerous leather Zulu and NATO straps of varying quality from other brands for a lot more. This is a nice product that slipped under my radar.\n",
            "My husband loved the watch and has received numerous compliments on it.  It was a great value!\n",
            "I gave the gift to my father for his birthday. He told me that he loved it and thanked me. Thank you very much. :)\n",
            "This is a really nice watch with a sleek and stylish design.  I received mine at no charge for the purpose of reviewing.  I receive many items in a similar way which means that I have many many items here, most of which, despite very good reviews, I am not inclined to keep for myself.  This watch is different.  I like it very much, like the styling, like the weight and like the quality.  I wear a smart watch most of the time but if I didn't, I am pretty sure this would be the watch I wear and I plan to keep it for either when I get sick of the smart watch or on those days that I am not in the mood to be wearing a watch that is smarter than I am.<br /><br />I should note that the watch I received has a dark brown face, not pure black like the photo and even the band seems to be dark brown rather than pure black but of this I'm not certain.  I know the product description states that this is a man's watch but these days I think this watch would be perfectly well suited to women who like large watches.  I think it has been classified at being for men by dint of its size alone, but not because there is anything particularly masculine about it.  It is a pleasant face that to my mind could be worn well by either men or women.<br /><br />As another reviewer pointed out, the instructions are not the best but alas for most of us this is not our first watch so we can probably figure out how to work all of the components.<br /><br />The watch comes nice packaged however the &#34;pillow&#34; that it rests on in its box is covered in some cheap vinyl like material and as a result it REALLY cheapens the look of the watch for me.  If you are giving this as a gift I think that pillow will detract from the value.  This would be much better off with a soft fabric pillow like felt or velvet.  The watch presentation would be far far classier.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  I like this watch a great deal.  It can easily be worn by men or women.\n",
            "This is a great watch.  Love the 2-tone!  Nice for dressy and for everyday.  Great price.\n",
            "Beautiful design, my girlfriend loves it. Better than it looks in the pictures.\n",
            "Good product\n",

            "Cosmetically is very nice and well built but the Chinese mechanical movement inside is pure garbage.  It stops after a period of some time no matter what.  It's the same movement inside watches costing $21 imported from China on Ebay.\n",
            "Love the look, packaging, sturdiness, smallish face, Tritium gas tubes, comfy and neat band, color and design. I am as happy wearing this as my Rolex and other pricey watches. This is definitely sturdier than my Luminox that broke way too fast. I'd like to get same model in all colors\n",

            "Got a Ferrari watch as a present and I must say I'm disappointed at the quality. The case, dial and mineral crystal is nothing spectacular. The straps are made in China and start cracking after only a few months use. I usually remove the straps off my watches and buy handmade quality leather straps. I took this watch apart and it has Japanese quartz movement that is worth $25-$30 by itself. This is not an Italian made watch, it's cheap Chinese junk with a simple Japanese movement. Don't be misled by the &#34;Ferrari&#34; logo. These watches are made in Asia and carry the flashy Ferrari brand.\n",
            "Awesome watch!  Easy to read and easy to use.\n",

            "2 month update:<br />Running like a champ, gains 1-2 minutes a week, still delighted!<br /><br />Orig Review:<br />Received in 3 days from LI watch thru Amazon, very delighted with watch, has a real military look + feel to it, one secret in advancing day of week dial is to advance to 4pm then rotate hands backwards to 10am + repeat cycle so it advances a day without having to rotate 2 revolutions/days to advance days, this was on the Orient website video of the Defender, case is 42mm, screw down case back + screw down crown, so I presume this is a more waterproof model much like the divers, Crystal is flat + has a slight rainbow effect when you tilt the crystal so I am guessing it has a non-reflective coating on it, lume works well, Band is very soft + pliable unlike bands on Orient Bambino + Other Lexington models that I have, Dial is Charcoal not Black + gives face a nice Matt Finish + Contrast to the blasted case finish, Too early to judge accuracy, will put it in my watchwinder tonight + wear if for a few weeks to advise accuracy at a future date, so far 5 stars + very pleased!\n",

            "Love this watch!!! I didn't think I'd like it as much as I do! The band has a nice sturdy weight to it and the clasp really snaps shut...so it would be hard for it to pop off and lose it. The pattern on the band is pretty cool too. The face is VERY thin...which makes it even cooler. I like that the band can be two different lengths (not by a lot) by choosing which bar to hook it to. The seller was great, too. This was an effortless transaction. Thank you, I love it!\n",
            "I thought the face of the watch was bigger than what is actually is, at least from the pictures it appeared to be bigger. I would also like to say that the battery is dead, I need to spend another $15? Now this was not the bargain, so I need to return it!\n",

Was very happy with it for about 4 months, then on vacation we got caught in a downpour and after that it was straight downhill.  Water got under the glass and caused it to fog up whenever I wore it.  Contacted Invicta to have it repaired under warranty and they wanted me to PAY to have it repaired under their warranty.  I proceeded to contact amazon who took the watch back and refunded my purchase price.  I would suggest staying away from invicta as they clearly do not care about their customer, or anything else besides making money.\n",

I will order a replacement as soon as I can, I love this watch so much.\n",

The stitching is  using thin thread and it's crooked. One of the stitches was skipped which is really noticeable because it's a contrast color. The ribbon for the compartment door is not scored properly and sticks out. I returned this. Definitely not gift worthy and overpriced for what you're getting.\n",

When it arrived I was excited to see that it was as beautiful as I had expected from Kate Spade; however, it didn't tell the time... obviously a feature I was interested in for a watch! I exchanged it easily through amazon and excitedly awaited my watch again, only to find, upon arrival, that the second watch didn't work either. I thought about taking the watch to a jewelry store for a new battery to see if that helped, but decided that the &#34;included&#34; battery on a $150 watch should work when you buy it! Instead, convinced I couldn't be so unlucky a third time, I exchanged it again. And happily, I received a working watch! However, about a week into wearing it... it stopped working! I am now sadly returning the watch for a full refund (thankfully Amazon's return policy is great).<br />I gave the watch 2 stars because it is a beautiful piece of jewelry... but that's it!

The brown band is also nice, and I'm looking for a plastic orange band.<br />I found a watch called Brooklyn Watch Company that has the B&R watch style but I read that it does not hold up well.  This Citizen's watch is very high quality, and the solar power is a great feature too.  My wife now wears the watch, and she's gotten some compliments on it.

At this price, it's worth getting the basic black as well, so you can see which you like more, or just to have one as backup...or maybe even so you can switch it out to go with a certain outfit (brown straps with black tie is a no-no in my book).<br /><br />The measurement for these straps is also DEAD ON.  Measure carefully to be *sure* you have something that will take up all the real estate between the mount points for your band - we're talking 1mm off can make an amazing watch look cheap.\n",

When I contacted Soleus directly, they told me that it is water resistant to 100m, but not water proof.  I asked them what &#34;water resistant to 100m&#34; means, as how could you exert water pressure on the watch if it can't go in the water, and they did not respond.  Likewise, when they admitted that their own documentation shows that swimming is an activity that can be used with this watch, they are still not willing to do anything to support their products.  It is obvious that they are using deceptive practices to try and sell cheap watches.  Please learn from my mistake and follow the advice in the subject line.\n",

            "UPDATE: See my comments below for starters. Now, with the band less than 3 months old, the short strap broke. It took the original band 18 months to break. I'm lowering the rating further now. Riddle: what good is a watch when its non-standard band breaks every 10 weeks or so? Not much!  This is a nearly perfect replacement for my watch's original band. I would have rated it higher but the original band only lasted about 18 months, and I assume this will be about the same. Also, as on the original, the &#34;ring&#34; that holds the loose end slides easily, so I either wind up with a lot of band extending beyond the ring or with a ring that is floating free without holding the end of the band at all. I just edited the review to lower the rating because the ring I mentioned above broke after a week. That makes the watch really awkward to wear because the end of the band sticks out from your wrist. Fortunately I had the old ring still, and I swapped them this morning.\n",
            "Its a nice durable watch. Took me a little bit to figure out how to adjust the band size.  Have to follow the arrows on the bottom they point to which direction the pins come out.  The face is a little smaller than expected but over all its a nice watch.\n",
            "I purchased/received this watch early April 2015 and by August 15 it had stopped working.<br />I took it to a jeweler thinking it needed a battery (my mistake) and the jeweler also missed the word &#34;solar&#34; printed on the face.<br />She opened the watch back, and upon returning it to me said that it is a solar watch, put it in the sun.<br />now the mother of pearl face is cracked (from jeweler's attempt to open) and per her recommendation, setting it in the sun for 8 hours has not helped.<br />i feel now that I have no recourse with either the seller, Seiko (who has not reposonded to my email), or my local jeweler (since I didn't notice the cracked face until I left the store).<br />I will no longer buy products from Amazon, that cost money more than I'm willing to toss in the trash.<br />grrrrrrrrr!\n",

            "You can see the numbers very good.When ever I hit something against it didn't turn how some digital watches do.The time kept changing so I had to reset it every now and than.Its a sturdy watch not too bad.However it died on me like a month later.Not too bad for the price of the watch if you change the batteries somehow.\n",
            "This watch was a nice surprise--very well made and attractive at a price that's a third of the two-tone AK watches I usually get. This is my first Armitron watch and it is quite nice as well as a surprisingly good value.<br /><br />One correction re: other review saying the band is 1/3&#34; wide. It is slightly over 1/2&#34; which is not heavy, but is also not a delicate band. It is about the width of a typical woman's leather wristband. This is probably a good width for the vast majority of users, but if you like a more delicate, narrow band, I think this wouldn't be a good choice.<br /><br />More re: band The alternating two-tone gold/silver pattern is gives a nice textured look, good for casual use and nice for work, but not dressy. To me, although the links are even in gold and silver, I thought it looked a little more on the silver side for the band. The oblong face--again, medium+ size, not big, but not small and delicate either--is classic and modern-looking with its oblong shape, rounded at the corners. The dial doesn't have numbers, but the dots are very easy to read against the goldish/silver-ish face, and there is a second hand which I always like to have (and you can actually see the diamond accent on the dial, unlike many watches that mention &#34;diamond&#34; in their name). I like the slightly beveled edge on the gold around the face because it changes it in the light, sometimes going darker, near-black when you move your wrist in a strong light. Armitron is known for reliability and keeping good time.<br /><br />One word of caution if your wrist is so small that you -always- have to remove links when you buy a watch. This band is adjustable, with one 1/2&#34; link that does come out (and, no, per other review, you don't need to loosen a screw to remove it. You just have to find the right side of the link and pop it open the same way you would if you were opening it to wear it, but the link will slip off if you need the smaller band. If your wrists are -very- very small, though, that one link will not be enough and because of the design of the band, there is nothing more than even a jeweler could remove. So, that would be my only caution, that this is probably not the best choice for those with very small wrists.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is a very nice watch that goes well with a variety of activities--and is so waterproof that you can even shower and swim with it! (I was happy about this as I often forget to take off my watch in the shower. With this one there were absolutely no problems!)  :e -very- very small, though, that one link will not be enough and because of the design of the band, there is nothing more than even a jeweler could remove.

            "This works for me very well. I was skeptical about this product because I didn't know what type of quality I would be getting. It's very high quality and I've been able to open no less then 8 different watches so far. They've been as big as 52mm and as small as 42mm. I'm a happy camper with this tool in my chest. Replacing batteries just got a lot easier for me. I can do it at home when I want to, and not have to run down to the Jewlery every time. Here's a TIP: Due to the fact that some of my watches have alloy bracelets and I didn't want remove them I sometimes just alighted two of three prongs on the watch and I was able remove the back that way. Furthermore I get a magnifying glass so you can see the battery hold down strap. Thayer very tiny and don't force the batteries out of the watch, you'll end up damaging it beyond repair possibly. It's just easier to do it that way then remove the watch band. In short this is a good product and I would recommend  it to a friend.  It paid for itself the first time that I used it, well worth the money.\n",

            "The watch is nice, but the battery died a day after I received it.\n",
            "I love my watch! Mine has a leather band that is quite stiff but that will soften with time. Looks exactly like the photo and I am very happy with it.\n",
            "It does not work.\n",
            "This Watch Was extremely big but too cute. Read the reviews know what I was getting with it being big. However I'm smart and looked up on YouTube how to shorten a watch band. So I fixed it and it's perfect now.\n",
            "Inexpensive yet good looking everyday watch that keeps good time\n",
            "I have always loved Casio & this watch didn't disappoint. I love the band which is not plastic & the buttons are set in just enough to not constantly hit them, but out enough to be easy to set things. Alarm is loud...well for a watch. Overall...this is a great watch that I'd recommend over & over.\n",
            "Love this watch! It's tiny, which is just what I wanted. It keeps time perfectly. I haven't had to readjust it once in the 6 months I've had it. It's also waterproof! The only downside is that the band is a little short. For those with bigger wrists it might not fit, but you could always make an extra hole in the band.\n",
            "Excellent.  Good price and fast shipping.\n",
            "just the best\n",
            "The watch is great the band I did not like it's small so I changed the band other  than that it's a great looking watch at an affordable price very stylish looking .\n",

            "very elegant!\n",
            "OK now....\n",
            "Like the watch so far. Just getting used to the functions although I probably will not be using some of the features. My only complaint is with the band. not a real fan of this type. It's a little difficult to get the strap in the first loop. I probably will check to see if there are different bands that can be put on this watch. But overall I am happy with the watch.\n",
            "I didn't read in the description that the face was mother-of-pearl, but it is still a very good looking and substantial watch.  Keeping perfect time, so far.  I went to a Kohl's store, where I had bought another watch, and the sales lady was good enough to size it for me.  Great experience in general, from Amazon, to seller, to Kohl's and to wrist!\n",
            "very nice. would prefer a mm or two smaller, but not to big. looks expensive and though not super heavy still feels like quality. and it's Swiss!\n",
            "the product has a nic e look and is as advertised.\n",
            "I absolutely love this watch it's classy, sporty and sturdy all at once\n",
            "Cool watch for the price. Only issue is no backlight when trying to check the time at night.\n",
            "i use it then for  few months then it broke the stones fell out\n",
            "As soon as I went to use it, the end piece fell out making it a little frustrating to do any kind of precision work. It got the job done in the end, but would not buy again if any sustained use is intended.\n",
            "I love the color!\n",
            "stop watch is not precisely pointing at 12 when reset, making me feel like i bought a knock off watch though its now\n",
            "This watch in the picture is not the item number above. Completely different watch.\n",
            "Beautiful. Great purchase.\n",
            "What a cool looking watch! Couldn't expect better quality for this price. Absolutely love it!\n",
            "The bracelet loses color and begins to peel. I am very sad with the purchase\n",
            "My watch is 14mm, band is 14mm had to trim total 2mm to fit.  Love the leather\n",
            "Get what you pay for. It works on and off throughout the day. Love the color and fit. Would have given it a 5 star if it worked correctly.\n",
            "No complaints. The watch is better than expected also great price and quick delivery.\n",
            "Love this watch. The colors are great and it looks just like the picture. Very happy with this purchase.\n",
            "Ok, and as described, but overpriced when compared to the exact same boxes available on eBay.\n",
            "to small of a watch\n",
            "I bought a few of these as gifts for my nephews who are huge Star Wars and LEGO fans, so these couldn't have been more perfect. The links are interchangeable for different color combos, and the characters can be added right to the band. I'm a little worried about durability, they don't seem as solid as most LEGO products, but so far so good.\n",
            "I'm very satisfied w/ the steel bracellet!\n",
            "Both Watch and band are nice and thin.  Display has big numbers that are easy to read even without glasses/cheaters. Stop watch is full size or seconds on bottom in time display.  I use this watch as a timer for my racing and it is easy to use. No year/month so yes you must reset but is reminds me of the older analog where you had to do the same.  The watch would get 5 stars if it took care of day of month.\n",
            "Awesome it fits just right!!! No problems with it everything works just right and it looks good very good!!\n",
            "My second just hope it last 25 years like the last one\n",
            "18 mm is the correct width, but the hole for the attachment pin is too far away from the watch.  I have a men's timex ironman triathlon watch.\n",
            "Great gift\n",
            "Bought this for my four year old daughter..It looks like a toy, seriously disappointing! and the straps makes it difficult to stay on. A toddler nor an older child will NOT be able to re-strap this watch on their own..I will need to sew some Velcro on the band but not too sure if this is possible. the straps were fraying straight out of the box. Another point, the face is quite small making it difficult for a toddler who is learning to read time. I would not recommend this watch. Poor design. I wish I could have returned this watch.\n",
            "Took about 2 weeks to break in and fit perfectly on watch.  Very comfortable to wear.\n",
            "Great watch for surfing- havent taken it off in 3 years has the tide and moon etc. Best G shock i own\n",
            "good\n",

            "Very good product!\n",
            "i bought it to give as a gift for either my husband or my daughter's boyfriend. it is very classy looking\n",
            "The watch is nice, just smaller in size than what I thought would be(face etc)\n",
            "Very nice watch especially for the money and its  pretty heavy and looks great!!<br />I can NOT hear the second hand tick AT ALL which IMO shows its quality!<br /><br /> The casing seems to be well made and should hold up to being submerged in water, but this is NOT a diving watch (or snorkel one lol)<br /><br />I personally have not used this in or around water (yet) so I can not comment on it in that capacity, but TO ME seems like it would hold up well if you needed to (or wanted to) wear it like at a water park or at the beach or pool (but why do that??)<br /><br />Chronograph works well and has kept perfect time since i set it! The only &#34;draw back&#34; is setting the date every other month because some months end on the 31st and others on the 30th so..... BUT THATS ALL WATCHES more or less that have a date setting.<br /><br />Unless you have Incredible Hulk wrists you are going to have to have links taken out to fit your wrist or you can do it your self with the help of some watch tools and a youtube tutorial though I would have it done by a jeweler or a watch store unless they are charging you half of what the watch costs then I would think about doing it you self. IF you do do it your self you can see the arrows that point in the direction in which the pins should be pushed/hammered out from the inside of the band.<br /><br />Overall I am VERY satisfied with this watches quality and look!\n",
            "My girlfriend loved this watch. Great quality, looks much better in real life. This guys never disappoints.\n",
            "This stylish, elegant and unusual Seiko clock will be impressive in any setting.  The silent sweep second hand is especially appreciated.\n",
            "I like it very useful\n",
            "The watch keeps accurate time and didn't need any adjustments to the band.\n",
            "It's a very petite small sized watch for being &#34;unisex&#34;.  Other than that, it's classic solid Timex.\n",
            "This is a nice watch for the price. I bought it for my little brother's navy boot camp graduation.  It is not stainless steel as advertised, so I cannot have it engraved, but its a real deal luminox.\n",
            "Military time - check.<br />Not too bulky or too many obnoxious features you will never use - check.<br />NOT the clich&eacute;  pink color just because it's a female watch - check.<br />Sleek design - check.<br />Water resistant - check.<br />Easy to clean - check.<br />Easy to program - check.<br /><br />Nurse approved - check!\n",
            "Watch band broke two days ago. I expected better quality.\n",
            "Beyond satisfied with this purchase. Great watch. Looks great. The buttons are hard to press though. But in honesty that does not even matter.\n",
            "Decided to update my review since this the third time I've purchased this watch now I clearly do like it. It's cheap. It works. It's small, much smaller than I thought, but it does the job and has a great price. Now if I could stop losing it (which is why I've bought three, not because it broke).\n",
            "Nice watch\n",
            "Only had it for like 2 weeks, not my everyday watch, but no real complaints so far. I have no problems connecting to my iPhone 6 plus, once connected the connection is pretty stable (disconnects every one in a while bit it also automatically reconnects). Water resistance tested against the ocean, still works. As for battery life, tbd at this point, but since I don't use it every day, I may not be the best to judge. The light flowering every review mentions is true and kind of annoying but not a deal breaker. If you can get it at a discount like i did, it's a really good deal.\n",
            "wife loved it but the pins holding it fell out two days after it came in. I thank the one she got probably was just a lemon so I thank ill get her a new one\n",
            "The strap design is beutiful, and wearing is confortable.<br />A small problem in this clip closure, which opens in some wrist movements.\n",
            "Set the time, worked a few minutes...ten minutes, then stopped....tried to replace battery, very disappointed! Gave to my son to wear....had to give back to me, does not work!!\n",
            "I just jumped on the g-shock band wagon. The watch is simple and stunning. Was delivered 3 days after I ordered\n",
            "This ended up being the perfect gift, a quality item with a lovely gift box. My nephew was thrilled.\n",
            "I use this watch for swimming laps and it works great.  It's so light I forget I'm wearing it.\n",

            "Nice quality, good looking, strap is kind of thin, it may not last long\n",
            "A good looking watch, easy enough to read.  Sufficiently luminescent.  Note: mostly plastic, but seems quite durable notwithstanding; and as a result is super light.  Fairly large.  A good sport watch, or a starter watch for a high-school age boy.\n",
            "Love it.  Put it on my favorite watch - easy to install with the watch band tool from Amazon.  Great looking and gives me a pop of color to put on my wrist.\n",
            "My son loves this watch! its a perfect size for his 10 year old hand, its comfortable, its water proof, and the light and watch features are easy to read and understand. So far it's great.\n",
            "Love this watch, I am in Germany for the time being and it stands out in a good way. great eye catcher, Also really loving the purple backlight.\n",
            "Perfect fit. Just like new. Watch a YouTube video for instructions on how to do the replacement, it's harder than you think.\n",
            "I'm overall happy with the watch but was very surprised the hands and hour-markers are not glow in the dark.\n",
            "It's good that Timex is making replacement bands for these Ironman watches, as that was not always the case--when the band broke, you tossed the watch away.  Now I had the band and battery replaced at the same time so hopefully I'm good for another couple of years of workouts.\n",
            "So cool\n",
            "It looks great on picture and from the distance until you have to touch it.<br />When you get closer then you see cheap plastic body. It is also not pleasant to touch.<br />Otherwise it is OK, runs good, silent as promised.\n",
            "I own two Klaus Kobec,they are class and very high quality.\n",
            "This watch is a nice timepiece, with a good weight to it. I'm happy with my purchase and the deal you get from Amazon. It's well built, and makes for a nice casual piece. See\n",
            "Quick shipment of watchband, however the leather is quite stiff and will take some time and work to get it to fasten to fit my wrist.\n",

            "Simple, classic, elegant,  looks amazing with almost everything!\n",
            "Very nice watch, displays great quality.  Real leather band.  Very small face.  May be difficult to read for some.  Very easy to set the correct time.  All papers included.\n",
            "Nice feels real and for a cheap price\n",
            "Amazing Watch, love it. I bought this product on 2011 still function and I never replaced the battery.<br /><br />Dude I have a question for you..<br /><br />Do you sell only the watch band?<br /><br />Thanks.\n",
            "Fantastic watch as alwayz...wrist band almost to small....but i have bug wrist and it still fit.\n",

            "Love the watch, perfect for a classic more relaxed professional look.\n",
            "This is a tough watch and looks good.  It came with a decent charge already on it, so all I had to do was set my timezone and it set itself, accurate to the second (I verified with time.gov).  The only issue is that you can't really see the digital displays at night, but you can still tell time with the analog hands.  Overall great product.\n",
            "I love it.\n",
            "I will admit the Invicta MSRP are definitely overpriced, and their service leaves much to be desired. However, I have owned Invicta watches for many years (15+) and have always had good luck with all of them. I don't think a 50mm watch is too big for my wrist, I have an 8 inch wrist. The Invicta hater who says he's over 6ft tall must have a much smaller wrist and a small frame. I wear 52 and 54mm Invicta's and they look good on me. So on a positive note, I like the style, the value, the selection, and of course the price of the Invicta's. Mine are all in perfect working order and still going strong after many years.\n",
            "Perfect size :)\n",
            "Mine showed up cracked and with no directions. Do not buy\n",
            "Although advertised as having an extra long band, no actual measurement is given. As other reviews reported, the band is not noticeably different from any standard watchband. I find it uncomfortable  to wear for more than short periods  of time.<br />So far as function is concerned ,  the watch loses a minute or two each day, and the calendar also needs to be reset every couple days.<br />The watch looks good, but doesn't do the job I bought it for. If the packaging hadn't been thrown out, I would return the watch.\n",
            "Extremely large, swallowed my little wrist. Looks more like a man's watch on the wrist. Love th fact that it's multi-functional, just too bulky.\n",
            "Slightly larger than I expected but very nice travel box\n",
            "Lovely watch, perfect size...not too large on a small-boned wrist, but not too small, either. Had no problem setting the date and time as others have indicated, but if you really need the date this isn't the watch for you--it is extremely difficult to see/read. Also, the second hand looks just like the other hands, so when taking a quick look it is easy to misread the time. That said, it is a beautiful and comfortable watch, with unlimited band adjustment that is easy to do yourself.\n",
            "Great watch, great price. The best price around on this watch. Classic styling yet extremely practical. Water resistant to 10 Bar/ATM. Swimming/snorkeling or anything short of scuba it works great. Great for a formal night out or everyday use.\n",
            "I loved it.\n",
            "good\n",
            "Very high quality. The fit and finish are top notch. Not having the word SEIKO on the clasp is not a concern of mine. I recommend this for anyone looking a watch band replacement.\n",
            "glass on watch was broke and hand to pay out of pocket,$10.80.cent send it back.\n",
            "This is currently my husband’s favorite watch. I think he liked it immediately thanks to its somewhat understated look.  It actually looks much better in person though the body is a little thicker than he is used to. The glass doesn’t bulge too much though, so there isn’t much distortion when you look at the time. The body and strap are a brushed black metal with the faintest, barely noticeable aged-bronzing on the edges of the strap.  The strap is easy to remove thanks to its pinch-type latch where you squeeze the edges at each side to release. When closed, the latch is not that obvious and blends in with the rest quite well. There are some chrome details. The outer Tachymeter bezel is chrome, as is the bottom half of an inner bezel.<br /><br />The main face has two chrome hands while a small upper left dial counts 30 minutes, small upper right dial the seconds in a minute. A lower center dial displays the day with a date window between the day and 4 o’clock position.<br /><br />There are 12 fairly large and well defined hour markers with luminous accents similar to the ends of the hands. The luminescence is quite weak which is ok; this watch tries to be understated rather than draw attention to itself though I can’t say it has entirely succeeded.  On a ring around the 12 hour markers you have 24 hours printed.  And a ring around that has various popular cities around the world listed for setting time zones.<br /><br />The time zones are set with the single left hand winder. Unfortunately for me at least, the text is too tiny for the timezones to be very useful without a magnifying glass. The time-zone winder rotates the entire ring around inside the watch probably so you can offset it for easy reading.<br /><br />On the right hand side there are three controls. The upper button starts and stops the stopwatch while the lower one resets to 0. The reset is not instantaneous as the second hand smoothly completes its 360 degree rotation back to 12. The stopwatch second hand is for the stopwatch only despite being a thin hand that is viewed in the main face. As previously mentioned, the second hand that runs all the time is in the small right hand face.<br /><br />The main dial for setting the time comes extended with a collar that you have to remove to activate the watch. The collar is too fiddly to do by hand but a pair of tweezers or needle nose pliers can remove it with the gentlest squeeze. Then you can set your time, day and date easily enough. When set you need to screw it down to its locked position which will prevent tampering and seal the watch from the environment. The watch is water resistant up to 330 feet, but only when the winder is screwed to the locked position.<br /><br />The watch has a five-year warranty which is void if the adjustment knob isn’t screwed down to its locked position.<br /><br />The watch looks much better on his arm than on its own. Despite being more of an understated design I have noticed a couple of cashiers at local stores gawk at it which was a bit odd. It’s a nice timepiece that he always wears when we go out. He tells me that part of the reason he does so is that it’s much nicer and more polite to be able to glance at a watch discreetly while driving or sitting at a table than digging a bulky phone out of a necessarily deep pocket somewhere on your person and can make for a nice fashion accessory.<br /><br />I really like it.tch second hand is for the stopwatch only despite being a thin hand that is viewed in the main face.

            "This watch is really not water resistant. I bought this watch for my wife to use it everyday when she is with our daughter. On the beach too not in deep water. After 2 times was this watchin the water it was failed and not working.<br />Nice watch but not in the water. 😟\n",
            "Excellent product, fast shipping.  Buy without hesitation.\n",
            "Very nice looking watch, good weight and thickness.  Band is quality even if not real leather, not cheap.  Makes for a great casual or dressy watch.  I really like the blue face.\n",

I was also glad it was an Elgin (my last Elgin went through the washer and dryer and still worked).<br /><br /> I was very pleased with this watch when I received it.  It is even much prettier in person.\n",
            "I spent sometime looking around at some nice display cases and I settled on this one because it has so many slots to accommodate my growing watch collection for the next few years. I didn't think it would be so massive, but I can deal with it as it displays my watches very well. I am also happy that it accommodates all of my big face watches, to include my Diesels. I was extremely disappointed in the build of the watch pillow cushions, especially for the price that I paid for the display case. The watch pillow cushions feel like they have some low quality cotton and sides made of cheap cardboard, all bound together by some cheap black material. I honestly may invest in purchasing some quality watch pillow cushions to match the overall décor of the display case. Once again, this is a great product that will fit watches of all sizes, and allows one to display their favorite timepieces.\n",

The band dries really quickly so it doesn't feel uncomfortable and I've even showered with it on and done dishes just to keep the band clean.  The face illumination is great, too.\n",
            "The watch works fine but the adjustments for day and date are finicky, hit and miss.\n",
            "For $17 can't be beat.  Took a week or two to dial in the tides.  Works good now.  Need to be a geek to get it programmed right and understand tidal intervals(thanks google).  Face scratches easily, but again it's $17.\n",
            "Love it! I got rid of the green band and swapped it with the &#34;Mokingtop 18mm Waterproof Silicone Rubber Watch Band Deployment Buckle&#34;. The band fit perfectly and the watch looks completely different now. Quite a bit more sophisticated. The watch is top notch, not some cheap knock off. Keeps time accurately and the second hand is right on the mark. I am completely satisfied with this purchase!\n",
            "exelente\n",
            "The finish on this is very nice, however, it is quite thick and bulky once it's on the strap and makes it a little cumbersome on the wrist (I guess it's designed that way so that it fits watch bands of all thicknesses.\n",
            "Excellent\n",
            "Nice watch\n",
            "Nice-looking watch. Comfortable to wear as the leather band/strap flexes with ease. A arrived right in time via Amazon Prime.\n",
            "This was a lot more BLING than shown in the picture.\n",
            "This watch began to lose time after about 4 months of use. There was no damage to the watch and the lost time kept getting increasingly worse. As of now, it loses about 20 minutes per day and has to be reset several times. I am in the process now of trying to get the device exchanged or repaired and will update review later with my findings.\n",
            "This has been a great rugged watch.\n",
            "Awesome\n",
            "Surprised and pleased with this purchase.[[ASIN:B00ZOEJ9QI Mudder Watch Band Link Remover Pin Tool Kit 5pcs]].  I used it to remove a link from my new watch. The caveat for me was to TAKE MY TIME WITH IT!  It gets a minus one star because the instructions were for another product (the picture and the instructions look like they should go with a product like the Leegoal Watch Link Remover with Pins).\n",
            "I did A LOT of looking around when my old watch died (Fossil) and I was drawn to the Seiko 5 line. The automatic movement appealed to me, and the crystal back plate is a nice touch as well. I bought this watch as my everyday work watch. I am a manufacturing engineer and go from working in the machine shop, to business meetings in the same day. This watch wears well and has great eye appeal to match my needs. It matches my business casual look very well. I love the black face and white hands. The red second hand tops off the look in my opinion. I like this watch so much, I will be adding more of the Seiko 5 series in the future.\n",
            "Don't buy it. Within two months its strap ripped apart. I barely wore the watch. UNBELIEVABLE.\n",
            "Looks nice for the price but give it a close look and you can tell it's a cheap watch.\n",
            "I like this product look so cute\n",
            "I should have researched the sizes and things better. I do not have any larger than average wrists, and I was on next to last hole on band. This maybe should be listed as women's or child's watch. Looks nice though. Is very thin and lightweight. Just very small.\n",
            "very good looking a great choice for a gift.\n",
            "Heavy watch, but I love it. Very pretty. I wouldn't call it grey, though. Doesn't match any of the greys I have in my wardrobe. It matches a couple putty colored items throughout my house. I still like the watch, but I purchased it to wear with all the grey outfits I have.  UPDATE:  I've grown to really love this watch. It has helped that every time I wear it, someone compliments me on it. I finally took it to have links removed because it's so big. My wrists are thick, but even I had to have two removed. To wear it like I should, I should have two more removed. But I like to wear my watches big. It still is not quite grey. But it's a unique color and one you'll never see in another watch.\n",
            "I really like this watch. The band is not a dark brown but I do like the color brown that is on it. Thanks Amazon!\n",
            "Great watch.  Loving it\n",

            "Nice time piece for the price. Invicta is always good quality! .\n",
            "I love this watch. I have a larger automatic watch that is just too heavy to wear all day at work. This watch is smaller, lighter and just what I was looking for in a ladies' work watch. Because it is automatic, I did not mind that it was a later model as I did not need to worry about a new watch with an old battery. Excellent price!!\n",
            "Great starter auto. Keeps reasonably accurate time. Small on the wrist, but works well with smaller wrists. Feels solid. I really enjoy this watch.\n",

            "I loved it got it early than expected\n",

            "the band is pretty small, more like a child's band\n",
            "Great watch I'd buy it again as I have, but a bigger face to read the date and the numbers would even better. It has an indiglow which makes seeing time in the dark worth it big time.\n",
            "Can you say AMAZING? Moto has a real winner with the 360. Kudos Motorola, Kudos. And thanks Amazon for putting the 360 in your warehouse deals. The pricing is just unbelievable.\n",
            "Love this watch! Great quality and great size. Definitely worth buying!\n",
            "i was very happy with it until just recently. bought in december 2014 and it was exactly what i wanted. then in july or august 2015 there were a couple of instances where the winding stem got pulled out inadvertently, which of course stops the watch. the 2nd time it got caught on some clothing and i realized it right away. that really shouldn't be happening so the stem is coming out more easily than it should.\n",
            "It was an excellent gift for my Wife\n",
            "very nice watch haven't figured out why this watch is worth 1500.00. I'm glad I got this watch on sale\n",
            "Locking clasp caught on Khaki pocket, broke after 36 days. Unfortunately Amazon only covers a 30 day warranty/return policy whereas Nixon covers a 3 year warranty so that's a $55 repair plus shipping; A waste of time and money, Job well done\n",
            "Its just what i expected. And it keeps time, very well. I just wish you would make the elastic bands a little bit larger, for people with fat fingers ( like me). ☺\n",
            "I bought this specifically to use on a canoe trip knowing it would get wet. It's simple yet very functional. I went swimming with it, dunked it in mud, and perspired heavily on it yet it kept going.  For me, it's the perfect outdoor watch. One thing to note is the description stated the band was nylon. It is actually rubber or plastic with a nylon outer layer.  Very function able and affordable.\n",
            "Love the look and weigh but a little hard to set date(could be I'm a little slow 😏)\n",
            "Bought this for my girlfriend (her choice) for a birthday present. She's worn it 2 times for a total of about 6 hours and went to put it on this morning and one of the mesh links had snapped in half and the other one on the same side was starting to stretch. The watch is a bit loose on her, even with removing a link on the band, so it shouldn't be stretching. Definitely not even worth the current price, let alone over $400.\n",
            "I love the look of this clock and the sound.  Mine has a variety of songs: a Disney song, a Beetles and The Titanic theme song, which my birds have dubbed their favorite.  If you have birds of any kind, they will look forward to every hour.  It's done it's job in our house--it cheers us all up. It keeps time perfectly.  I love how the light sensor prevents it from going off at night, and the fact we can switch to Christmas songs in December, though  I keep forgetting to do it.  I'll write it on the calendar!  About once every couple years, it starts to sound muffled, and that's when I realize it's time to change the battery.  I can't help but think that is the reason so many reviewers think the sound isn't good. Batteries should be brand new, and then last a long time.  But if they are low at all, it won't sound half as good.  The only problem I had was the pendulum stopped swinging when I moved it. I can make it move, but it stops. I'm not sure if it's a problem with it not being level, battery connection or just that the pendulum is no longer in the correct place.  I don't even care, I like it so much.  Guests look at it and compliment it, not even realizing it should be swinging.  I'm having a clock doctor come for my coo-coo and grandmother, so I'll have him take a look.  He thinks it's the battery.  I'll try to remember to update you on what the problem turned out to be.  If I don't have the answer in a week, message here, and I'll let you know.\n",
            "Very nice, clean looks.  Bought it for my son, liked it enough to buy my own.\n",
            "This is my 2nd G- Shock and certainly won't be my last. You just can't beat these watches for their toughness and versatility. And the price for all this watch does is a steal. This watch is amazing and looks even better in person and it took about 2 minutes to set up. Great deal.\n",

            "Surprisingly high quality for the price. I get compliments on it every single day. I've already linked several other friends so they can but it as well. The thin band lends it a feminine feel and the neutral grey allows me to pair it with everything.\n",

I jumped at the price (slightly more than $30) and while the watch looks fine, the watchband bracelet feels cheap, and the overall feeling of the watch is that it isn't as good as an Invicta or something directly above it in price class, like a Bulova.  While the tiny dials on the face make for a nice complement, don't fool yourself into thinking they are readable or give you any information.<br /><br />In addition, mine arrived with a dead battery.  The retailer did reimburse me the cost of getting a new one.<br /><br />It's an okay watch, but the feel on my wrist reminds me there was a reason I got it at such a deep discount.\n",

            "I love this watch, the details are so cute. BUT IT BROKE IN TWO DAYS!!! I'm a Dental Assistant and I needed a watch for work so I decided to go the extra mile and pay the extra money for this one and I am very disappointed with this watch.\n",

            "Great value.  I really like the classic and clear face on these Seiko dive watches.  Nice to know I can wear it ANYWHERE without a worry.  I also own an orange monster and that thing is a tank.  200m is more than enough depth rating.  Most recreational divers don't go anywhere below 50m.\n",
            "I would have given this 5 stars except for the clasp on the band which requires a click on each side of the watch band.  Otherwise, the watch works well and looks nice.  I have only had it for a week so I cannot comment on how long this one will last.  Note that I love the outdoors and am tough on my watches.\n",

            "Nice fit love the color great for apple watch mine is a 42mm and it fits great\n",

            "Nice watch. This is my second Seiko, the other being an automatic SRP275K1. I was looking for a &#34;filieger&#34; pilot-inspired design  and this watch got me at the orange highlighted main markers and hands. The watch is a quartz chrono which looks as depicted, no disappointments. Solid Seiko build both in the case and band. The watchface is nicely detailed with the succession of outer and recessed inner rings adding a nice depth. The orange highlighted hands lends a very good visibility/readability to the time in what could be construed as a &#34;busy&#34; watchface as is the case for most chronographs. The outer ring markers as well as the hands are lumed with bright and lasting seiko lume. The top subdial, triggered by triggering the chronograph is for accruing laps by the minute up to 1 hour, while the bottom sundial keeps on ticking the seconds providing a second-hand during chronograph use.<br />The band is well built, easy to resize by removing links (arrows on the underside indicate the direction to remove pins easily by pushing with a small screwdriver/nail/paperclip) and I appreciate the double locking mechanism. I personally successfully tried swapping out the band for a nato strap (not provided) which is easy, provided you hold the lug-cover part of the band firmly in place while compressing the springbar.<br />Both case and band have a brushed front finish and shiny side finish which provides nice detailing.<br />The only drawbacks for me are : 1) the size, it is a rather large watch for my slender first albeit well-balanced with the band so it looks big but not ridiculously oversized, so be warned 2) a very minor drawback is the small date window at the bottom of the bottom subdial which is not very readable and therefore not very useful...it could have been omitted.<br />Altogether a good solid buy with no regrets.\n",
            "Like it... it's really cool....\n",
            "I received my watch very fast and it was beautiful and authenic. I would love to shop again with this buyer.  It hard to find authenic name brand items and the price was awesome. Thank You!!!\n",
            "Got this so I could travel without worry about losing a watch. It is cute and easy to see. However, the settings are hard to manage and the buttons take strong fingers to hold and switch. I had to have my husband set the watch as I was unable to do it.\n",

            "This is a all made rubber watch band.  It was a replacement for my Pulsar dive watch. IT matched almost exactly. Could not be happier with my band.<br />My only issue really, is that the strap is too long and tends to stick up if you don’t put the slider bar near the end.  Would buy again though.\n",
            "This Topwell watch is very unique and different. The watch is made of red sandalwood and white Canadian maple wood and honestly I have never seen a watch quite like this one. I also love the fact that it is Eco-friendly with an earthy feel and look to it. It's waterproof, works just like any other analogue watch and very light-weight. The colors of this watch is beautiful and it fits comfortably on my arm without having to do any adjustments. The watch is adjustable if needed so that is a very good thing. This is a great gift for any women in your life. The craftsmanship of this watch is amazing and your sure to get many compliments when wearing it.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review and opinion.\n",
            "I received this today, and will be returning it tomorrow. The dial color is not at all what was pictured on the website. It is a much darker shade of blue, which almost looks black under non-sunlight conditions. The main reason I purchased this watch was for the looks, and for the color of the blue dial specifically. Pretty disappointed.<br /><br />I can't comment on the functionality, reliability, or robustness of the watch as I did not use it.<br />I hope this review helps others who are interested in the watch because of the dial face color.\n",

            "i used to purchase a pro-trek and then this watch changed my mind. i know the resistance of the g-shocks and this is the first three sensored g-shock. i bought it through a local dealer. i am really happy to see that the sensors works correct and the datas are accurate. my only complain is the resin band. it really hurts my wrist. the back of the metal buckle on it is unconfortable.\n",

            "My wife bought this watch and really likes it. No more batteries to buy! The so called watch band is cheap and so stiff it is hardly bendable to get around her wrist.We are purchasing a genuine leather band. Only four stars because of the band.\n",
            "Only had now for a week or so but seems good.  Basic watch functions, nothing fancy.  Does have luminescent watch hands.  Nice and light and I like the way it sits on my wrist.  So far so good.\n",
            "The watch is super simple and slightly feminine. I need it for nursing school for the third (&#34;sweeping&#34;) hand and find the watch to work out nicely since it is a fair price, has 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime Student, and looks nice on the wrist, if I may say so. However, I do not believe that this watch is waterproof and so I would advise (future) users to be cautious around water.<br />To set the time, all you have to do, which can be slightly difficult, is pull out the tiny knob on the side and keep twisting and twisting it until it reads the correct time. Afterwards, you just push it back in.\n",

            "It is a typical Casio watch.  Within three weeks of ownership the watch band broke off one of the pegholders.  It's happened to every Casio I owned, but it's been a while and I hoped they had fixed the problem.  Obviously they didn't.  On the bright side, when I could still wear it, it gave me options I didn't have before.  But the info guide gives vague directions, like it could help find my Iphone but didn't tell you how.  If they could ever fix the watchband problem it would be a good buy.  Luckily it only cost me $30 or so and not the suggested price.  Do not buy if you actually plan to wear it.\n",
            "Good product\n",
            "Great Quality watch. I did have to have a few links removed but no an issue I expected that. For the money, you would be hard pressed to get a better quality watch from an online retailer. I am by no means a watch aficionado but needed something nice to wear to work and this fit that for me.\n",
            "While the look of the watch is very modern and resembles that of an Apple product, it is FAR from Apple quality. But, what do you expect for a watch less than $5? Setting the clock and date is a bit tricky. I only figured it out by pressing all of the buttons hoping that I would get somewhere.<br /><br />Agreeing with others, it seems silly to have the words &#34;LED WATCH&#34; etched on the face of the screen. It's small, but still annoying and takes away from the watch.<br /><br />The wristband is wider than most watches.\n",
            "Very nice\n",

            "Found it cheaper in Walmart and it did not seem to be the quality of a Disney product\n",
            "This tool is really easy to use.  It is fairly well-built.  My only gripe is that the adjustable &#34;platform&#34; part falls off easily when dialed up to the higher settings (hence the 1 star deduction.)  Beyond that small issue, it was very simple and easy for me to remove 3 links from my new watch.<br /><br />For those of you who might read those reviews saying that it is difficult to use, or that some users broke many pins, I would say that those seem to be cases of user error.  This thing really could not be easier to operate.  If you cannot take your time and figure out which way your pins should be pushed out of your band, you should may wish to just save yourself the aggravation and take your watch in to a professional to be re-sized.\n",
            "I love my new watch and I haven't even worn it yet! It is to big and I don't have any tools to take a link or two out of the band. I don't know if it was supposed to come with a tool for that, but it should! My only complaint is that I can't wear it until I figure out how to make it fit!<br />The watch is heavy duty, looks magnificent and will catch an eye or two, no doubt!\n",

            "Watch is big and looks nice. However, the packaging is really poor. When I received the package, the watch fallout of the box and inside the envelop. The watch holder is broken already and the box is cheap.I would not recommend to purchase.\n",

            "I've always wanted a mantle clock, didn't want anything that would be too extravagant for my home but wanted something eye catching with beautiful chime(s) ......THIS IS IT! I absolutely adore this one and I wear nothing but Seiko watches and have had them for years, so that was a no brainer for the make I wanted. It looks so well made, not cheap!  It is exactly 10 1/4h x 16 3/8w x 4 7/8d. Also of course the delivery was right on.\n",
            "Awesome!\n",
            "Really good for the price, my  daughter really likes it.\n",
            "I don't understand how these people are able to use this watch for 2days or so. Cuz mine only lasts for 6~10hours. Im not a heavy user. Just read notifications and respond and what not. Think its facer app that take too much ram memory and bettery. But it does charge fast. And even thou you gotta bring the charge dock for your traveling, charge dock is small and cute so it doesn't bother you much.  My biggest concern is when I use voice control. It understand my voice reall well, but the problem is, it doesn't do the action but does Google search for example. When I say &#34;heart rate, heart rate monitor, or check my heart rate&#34; it doesn't do the action but show me the result of what Google got. I don't know its my personal problem or everybody is on the same track. Might be the language problem; I'm using my phone and watch with Korean language.  And after battery gets to below 15%, it automatically goes to battery saving mode which I can't do any actions no more than 5 seconds. After 5 seconds screen goes out and you can turn it on back for 1min. So I always stop the battery saving mode asap.  I'm using this for 2weeks so far and these are my first impression of moto360  Ok its been about a month now. and battery capacity became so much better now which was main problem that I had. I cant figure it out why, but I can use it at least 16hours or so with regular use I check time approximately 20 times and get 100 notifications. and this is enough when you wake up and leave home at 9am. and come back 11pm still battery stay 30~40% and I am very pleased with this.\n",
            "As good as it gets.  One of the 4 facial nuts fell out shortly after I started wearing it, but other than that no complaints\n",
            "all good\n",
            "Great watch, features work well, compass is spot on. Band is a little stiff but all around great quality\n",
            "I like it but my husband don't. It's his gift but he wears it.\n",
            "Out of the box the watch would intermittently stop and start. I replaced the battery and the problem persisted. I wanted to love this watch because of Dieter Ram's legacy with Braun, but the build quality is not there.\n",
            "Really nice\n",
            "I'm a perfectionist .... Love this watch ! Looks great , holds up to the elements w/o scratching , even saltwater fishing .\n",
            "I love how this watch looks and feels! I am always getting compliments about it every time I wear it! Ignore all the comments about the ¨messed up roman numerals¨. It is intentional due to the design of the watch and the limited space on that watch. It is a common way to do the numerals. Just look at other people's comments who explain it well among the reviews.\n",
            "After doing much research, I decided to go with this beautiful classic Bauhaus design. After being shocked at the price tag of the nomos, I found the Rodina and I am more than pleased. It proudly presents itself as made in China, and is probably the best bang for your buck in terms of a classy watch. This amazon listing is for the black band, which is definitely dressier and can most likely be worn during formal occasions mostly. The blue tempered hands show up at an angle, a nice subtle touch. My model arrived with the grooves in the smaller second-hand face, and an 'R' on the crown.<br /><br />Now there are many avenues in which you could get this watch, but I chose amazon because 1. Prime shipping, didn't want to wait for overseas shipping, got it in 2 days. and 2. warranties, I know amazon has decent/good customer service, and I trust them more to deal with any potential issues rather than a random chinese watch company website. Overall, the watch looks better in person than in photos and I am extremely pleased.\n",
            "Excellent value for the money. Attractive and practical.\n",
            "It came with three, but I've only used one.  I haven't had a single scratch on it and it doesn't impede the visibility of the screen whatsoever.  Even with the screen off and viewing at an angle, you can barely tell it's there.  It seems to be made of a similar material as an InvisibleShield and applied in a similar fashion.\n",
            "Decent watch. So far no problems with it. It is a big watch. The buttons on the sides are a little hard to push sometimes. I do like it but rarely wear it because it doesn't conform to the curve of your wrist. So a little uncomfortable but to each their own.\n",
            "the size is a btbigger than i expected but it still looks great\n",
            "It's a nice strap but I have little wrists so it's gigantic on me, I guess I'm just being a sour puss.\n",
            "Gift for my dad, classy watch, cant go wrong\n",
            "Updating my review from 1 to 5 stars - the first item arrived broken. I returned it, and really didn't do anything other than leave a review thinking I'd just move on. But the seller (LuguLake Direct) contacted me immediately and arranged a replacement even though the item was currently listed out of stock (even offered a discount for my trouble). It arrived quickly and works great! LuguLake Direct was very pro-active in their communication and e-mail replies always arrived same day or next day. It was very easy to work out a replacement unit.   The winder itself works great and is very quiet. I have it on my nightstand and I can't hear a thing. Overall very pleased.\n",
            "Awesome watch. I have always loved Casio for their strong cheap multifunction watches. But this one is totally worth the price. It has a very accurate compass, worldtime, alarm, stop watch, etc. It looks great, it is water proof, it does look very resistant.<br />For anybody who might need to use the compass function, or just want a cool looking watch (multi-funtions too) I recommend it.\n",
            "So the watch is perfect everything works great and it does look nice. After getting the watch though it is a bit lighter than I expected which is not a bad thing but it makes an odd noise when the band moves. This is just personal opinion but for someone looking for something that is very classy and not very expensive this would be a perfect watch.\n",
            "Nice watch for the money very impressed.\n",
            "This watch is very attractive,comfortable and the dial is very clear and easy to read. The hands are blue and it looks very elegant against the white face of the watch. The clasp is very easy to operate,just depress the button that lies flush with the strap and it releases.I am only giving three stars because the date has not and will not change despite being set and reset using the instructions. Therefore I will return this watch and ask to exchange this for another. Otherwise this is a very elegant,stunning,lightweight watch.\n",
            "My twin girls really like it the only issue we have had since first review is that there is a little rubber type strap that you need to keep put on that can be taken off and the girls keep losing it.  With 5 year olds this is something I feel would be better if attached permanently.\n",
            "It is a nice watch. The band and case are clearly high quality.  Although it is larger than I expected, it isn't too, too large for me. I read discussions that the retail price is inflated and unrealistic etc. That might matter to me if I was paying that price.Time will tell how durable the Sapphitek Crystal (the crystal is flat not raised) is. I have owned expensive, movement watches in the past, but definitely prefer the accuracy and durability of quartz since Seiko first introduced theirs. It keeps perfect time and it isn't a big deal if something should happen to it. I like the look and feel and hope to have it a long time.\n",
            "a good brand\n",
            "I'm a repeat customer for the Timex Ironman watch. Even though I'm a woman with a very small wrist (and have to cut extra holes in the band). I always buy a man's watch and particularly love this model, with its large digital display and excellent Indiglo lighting. I wear my Timex when I swim laps and have never had any problem with leaking, as some have reported. Eventually, the Indiglo dies--in advance of the battery. When that happens, I know I'm ready to buy another.\n",
            "Awesome watch. Be certain to read the instructions first for proper programming.\n",
            "Stunning watch - unfortunately, it was too small for my guy.\n",
            "This is a beautiful watch, far better than anything most American's wear. I own 3 Bulova wrist watches already, and wear them near daily.  That being said, I am a little disappointed in this particular Bulova compared to my other 3.<br /><br />My first issue is that the Bezel, does not rotate. I would have expected this from lesser companies, but not Bulova. Second, the wristband locking mechanism is somewhat flimsy by comparison to my other Bulova watches. Finally, the watch seems a tad bulky, given that it has a fake bezel. I would have excepted the extra bulk if it was a fully functioning timepiece, however this item is definitely an example of form over function.<br /><br />Despite my gripes, it is a beautiful, and accurate watch. I could have returned it, but it was just too beautiful to part with!\n",
            "A good inexpensive timepiece\n",
            "This watch I was very disappointed with. It worked less than 3 days. I'm a little confused if the battery is dead or not. I works for a few seconds, then you turn your wrist to look at it and the hands are still. I'm like you have got to be kidding me... I'm thinking it must be a gearing issue, I don't know. There were no instructions on how to set it, and the watch was already ticking when I got it. IMO, when you purchase a &#34;new&#34; watch, especially if its not in a store/mall showcase, it should have those plastic things in between the knobs so the consumer can remove activate the battery at that time. I really do like the watch, but I am hesitant to wear it &#34;not working&#34;. I would hate for someone to ask me what time it is, and I don't have it...\n",
            "Very good\n",
            "This is a spectacular quality winder for the cost (although as others have pointed out, the logo plate on top is kind of cheap looking). Finish is beautiful outside and in -- even the packaging was elegant. It would be helpful if the pads were a little bit larger in diameter, but that's not a big deal... I'll post back (today is 8/25/15) if the motor gives out like some have complained.\n",
            "If I could give zero stars I would.... This watch didn't even last a month. Water got into the face and it is all foggy! Can't return the item. Buy a G-Shock instead!\n",

            "The black frame is painted and removes by touch of a nail\n",
            "I love the watch; however, after wearing it for a few days (including in the pool) the band itself has changed colors so now the watch is a weird two-tone instead of white.\n",
            "It appeared blue but the color is  royal blue. It was also described as sleek but it is a huge face watch.\n",
            "My husband loved it!!!!\n",
            "Received my box with a bit of shipping damage on the back side. The &#34;wood&#34; was scratched off showing the paperboard underneath. The box is well made and seems sturdy; but, I live on an island the the paperboard is going to sweel up like a whale on the beach... &#34;Ebony Wood&#34; = NOT! My photo clearly shows the paperboard.\n",
            "Horrible watch, even for the money, the shine fades in less than a week. Also the edges wear fast and scratch easily.\n",
            "Love the color and the face of the watch. The size everything. The one thing that's bad is the band scratches easily. I've only had it s few days and I have several light scratches in the metal band\n",
            "I love this watch! The case itself is well made and it is really cool to be able to see the inter workings of the watch on the backside of the case. The leather strap is solid, well stitched and soft to the wrist on the inside. I can't wear my watch daily, so I have to set the date and time before I wear it quite often. I might recommend a battery or solar powered watch for someone that doesn't wear a watch everyday. I knew that this watch was an automatic when I purchased it, so this is not an issue for me. I hope to wear this watch for years to come.\n",
            "I thought it would be metallic but it was shiny plastic. It's alright and it comes with a variety of rope and chains to have variations. It was nice\n",
            "My wife love it.  Perfect fit.\n",
            "Great watch. It's not only used for workouts anymore due to its stylish and colorful looks. Got two of these in different colors\n",
            "BUENOS\n",
            "Used this today for a 3 mile run. It was a great experience. I love the touch screen makes using during your run so simple. Even though it looks big its not heavy. The set up instructions were so easy.....I love the  music option also.\n",
            "After making several trips to local jewelers to find a replacement watch band in a long length, I was pleased to find it on Amazon and just as pleased to receive it within three days.  The quality is quite good--in fact, I think it's the exact band the jewelers carry--and it was half the price. A YouTube video showed me how to attach it myself. Nice to be done!\n",
            "This is my first Casio Baby-G. I wanted to get a sporty watch with a little hint of girly. Was looking for something that I can alternate with my Rose Gold Nixon watch. Loved that this watch also has the Rose Gold tones that match perfectly with my jewelry. Very attractive looking. I also do not have any problem with the digital display/illumination as other reviewers have. Fast shipping and great deal.\n",
            "It’s really amazing watch.\n",
            "My husband has had the same Timex Expedition watch for many years. He just buys a new band when the old one wears out.<br />He found this band to be stiffer than the previous ones, but still finds it comfortable to wear, and is very happy with his purchase!\n",
            "Love the watch.  I've had it for about a week and I am enjoying it as my every day watch.  The band which is a little stiff but is loosening up\n",
            "Watch face smaller than appeared in advertisement\n",
            "Great product for the price. Automatic Time synch  for your time zone with Daylight Savings Time.\n",
            "I have had this watch for about a month now. Great watch for $40.00. Can't beat the value. I like the metal side buttons verse the plastic buttons that the more expensive G Shocks have. I was thinking about going with a more expensive G Shock solar but realized that the solar is a newer technology in watches and is a little bit harder to read. Additionally I figured that even with a solar watch you still need to change the battery and the battery might be more expensive then the standard watch battery that you can buy and change yourself for about $3.00. I am still debating whether to just buy a cheap Casio $15.00 dollar watch next time since no matter what watch I purchase the band seems to not last over the typical span of the battery. This G shock costs about $20.00 just to replace the band then an additionally time and energy replacing the battery.\n",
            "First of all, this watch is not waterproof.  It immediately died upon being exposed to water on a water slide.<br />Second of all, it is almost impossible to program.  Nothing about the buttons is logical, and the instructions are impossible to understand, as they are included for a variety of watches and you have to figure out which process applies to this watch.  In short:  a piece of junk that is a complete waste of money.\n",
            "cheap quality. over priced.\n",
            "Very good watch.  I would recommend it.\n",
            "Band looks and feels great.  Awful quality though.  After re-sizing the band (removing a link) links on the other side of the watch are falling off.  Do yourself a favor and spend a little more.\n",
            "Awesome,!\n",
            "Braclet very large.Had two links removed by jewler.A very nice watch.Very good looking timepiece\n",
            "Too big for a normal girl's hand. Almost humongous. Dont buy unless you have a huge wrist or a craze for chunky watches.\n",
            "Good\n",
            "The first thing that you need to know about this bracelet is that it's HEAVY! This may be appealing of offputting, depending on your tastes. It's well machined: As it appears, it's made of goodness knows how many individual steel bits. Love that it has screws for adding / removing length. Buckle is nicely made. It's surprisingly comfortable. Wish that it were possible to do small size adjustments *without tools* -- our wrists are different sizes at different times of the day -- but that's why I carry a spring-bar tool! Beware, the end links, while straight, are a bit 'chunky', and this bracelet doesn't fit on all of my 20mm-lug-width watches.\n",
            "Thank you for quick service. Watch looks great! Works fine.\n",
            "freakin cool watch! very heavy, not for kids, which is what I was looking for.\n",
            "easy to view\n",
            "Im generally pleased with this watch.  It looks great and i get compliments on it.  The price indicated it was marked down from $850 which is total BS.  This is a good $100-150 watch, nowhere near worth anything over $300.  Ive owned it for about a week and the finish on the band is already rubbing off in spots where my wrist rests on my desk at work.  It does keep the time pretty well - its only about 1 second off of my phone's clock which i used to sync it a week ago.  The chronograph hand runs for up to<br />2 hrs from what i can tell.  The instruction pamphlet does the job.  Overall id say this watch is definitely worth the $85 i paid for it.\n",
            "The watch looks absolutely astonishing\n",
            "This watch is quite simply the most beautiful watch I've ever owned.  In the considerable myriad of competition among quartz watches, smart watches, and mechanical watches I was tempted to go for a smart watch.  When I thought it through, there seemed to be a nagging question about just how long the smart watch craze will really last; certainly concerning the constant changes in software and updates, not to mention the concept itself. My decision to buy this simple, elegant watch from Oris is the result of an understanding that this is a real timepiece of tremendous value, both in its quality and its purpose.  It only tells the time and displays the numerical date, that's it.  Actually, what else does a watch really need to do?  So purchasing one that I will be proud to pass on is significant.  It is one of the best purchasing decisions I've made in a long time.\n",
            "to heavy beautiful watch\n",
            "bought it for my husband and he is happy with it/ so i like it.\n",
            "Really cheap watch that works just great!\n",
            "Kind of like a MB3. Might be fun to play around with but don't want to be caught by your friends with it on your arm.\n",
            "My son LOVES it..I've bought a few on here that did not last a week...this one looks like a winner..very nice..plus AMAZON gives a warranty for 2 years you can't go wrong\n",
            "nice folks to do business with and a very nice strap\n",
            "Nice watch band\n",
            "THE GOOD:<br />Leather quality and stitching are nice. Leather is soft and has a slight amount of stretch, which allows the watch sit firmly in place without excessive tightening (old band was either slipping around or extremely tight depending on the hole I chose). Color is nice and seems modestly resistant to scratching. Hardware isn't bad but I have had some paint chipping where my wrist would touch the table.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />The extra strap which loops through the main strap to secure the watch is too short. This causes the buckle to sit more on the side of the wrist as opposed to opposite of the watch (photo1). This also causes the tail of the strap to wrap around almost up the the face of the watch (photo2), which is unsightly. I measured my wrist to be ~13cm/7-1/8in, which puts me in the third smallest hole out of the 9 provided. I am a fairly average sized man, so I was surprised to see I was so far shifted toward the short end. A larger wrist would cause the buckle to sit even farther up the side of the wrist.<br /><br />The metal loops that hold the tail of the strap are also too loose and allow the strap to slip free once trimmed. I have to keep pivoting them to lay flat against the band otherwise it will flop out (photo3&4).<br /><br />THE VERDICT:<br />There aren't a lot of options on Amazon for similar products from different manufacturers, so you have to take what you can get or look elsewhere. It is wearable, but the minor annoyances are not trivial. For the time being, I will continue to use this band but it will likely be replaced soon.\n",
            "Love it\n",
            "Way to big there should be a way to adjust\n",
            "Love\n",
            "It's an easy application and I don't see any air bubbles after a day I applied the protector. But, it doesn't quite fit over the screen as it is too small and leaves a 1-2mm gap around one side. I compared all 6 films I received and they are all smaller than the watch face.\n",
            "Nice\n",
            "Simple, reliable. Wish I could see it in the dark though. Price is right for the quality.\n",
            "good watch. just bad quality\n",
            "It came defected. The hands do not move so the only thing that keeps track is the digital clock.\n",
            "barely all my watches fit.\n",
            "poorly made - not comparable to the original - thinner and shiny\n",
            "I would order over and over again. Great service, fast shipping! Such a beautiful watch. My boyfriend loves it!!\n",
            "Just what you expect from a Timex watch.  Modestly stylish and highly functional.  As with most watches these days, it is difficult to adjust the date with the stem, since it is hard to get it in the half-retracted state needed.\n",
            "Love it. Looks really nice.\n",
            "Great watch!!  EZ to see and read dial in the dark.\n",
            "My wife found this watch and I bought for her as a surprise. It is really nice and styleful present and looks nice on lady`s wrist even if she has a tiny wrist too. This watch will serv for a long time. I recommend this nice watch for everybody who try to find nice present for a lady who important for him.\n",
            "First off I  received the product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. Now for my review. I could not be happier with my purchase. The watch is beautiful. The gold trim really sets off the black face on the watch. It looks like a very high-end watch.  I love it.\n",
            "Super like this watch looks nice to my hands I even bought 2 pcs one for me and one for my mom! And it's really a great deal and price when I purchased this MK watch!\n",
            "I am disappointed in this watch simply because it was advertised as &#34;unisex&#34; but it is much too large for my wrist.  The package actually says it is a men's.  I'm keeping it for outdoor work as it isn't worth returning.\n",
            "thanks\n",
            "Very nice, Fits perfect.  The only thing is that is very hard to coordinate all the functions with only one movement with the button.  It should be easy to adjust the date but you have to turn the clock 24 hours in order to advance one day.  But the quality is very nice.\n",
            "Love this watch.  I purchased the mens' version to have enhanced numbers and have a larger crystal as seems to be fashionable now.  The Indiglo is very helpful because it lights up the time in the dark or a dimly-lit restaurant.  Timex is my daily-wear watch for an aging baby boomer, and I enjoy the black watch band.<br /><br />Timex brand watches are hard-working and good looking.  Purchase one of the many styles.\n",
            "Cheap watch. Bought it for looks, very satisfied with the product (go pirates)\n",
            "Nice.\n",
            "That's exactly what I want!!\n",
            "Great watch! At first i didn't know how to use this watch because its my first analog watch. But now i love it!The good part is no battery need it so no worries on constantly changing batteries!!\n",
            "Looks beautiful and goes with black, brown and colorful outfits.  Also keeps time well.  I have had the watch for about one week.    Update: the band does not wear well. See picture.   Looks very worn out quickly.\n",
            "I've wore it for nearly two years.  I recommend waterproofing the band, or treating it.  A few water accidents and it will not look particularly dressy. I'm an outdoorsman, and I will say it held up well. Still looks great, keeps good time, etc.  Fashion tip: matches really well with fall color schemes.\n",
            "Great product,arrived very fast<br />My only issue is its too long and there's no way<br />I can reduce it to fit my hand but overall great product\n",
            "Amazing\n",
            "Watch is stunning, but it is defective. Watch not holding its time after two days... Hoping replacement doesn't do the same.\n",
            "This watch is awesome looking just got it today and the shipping was more than on time. I love the stealth look of it, not to overstated and definitely not short in the looks department. I read where other reviewers said that it is hard to read the time at night, and I must say they are correct for the digital aspect, but from the analog perspective, I can see it very well. Great product, awesome looks. Thumbs up G-Shock.\n",
            "disappointed. it says long but not really. I wouldn't buy again\n",
            "I really like this watch! The display numbers are large and easy to read. I was tired of using my iPhone 6 as a stop watch, the display would go to sleep mode. Now with the Casio in the stop watch mode it is always available to view. I walk for 30 minutes every day. The Casio is worth more to me than I paid for it, just for the stop watch. I like the watch display, very much. At a glance you see the month, day of the week. The day is displayed both is numeric and letter. Along with hour, minutes, seconds. The metal band is comfortable and nice looking.\n",
            "I love this little watch. It keeps time well, it looks great, and I wouldn't trade it for anything!\n",
            "This watch was perfect for my intended use. I know that the instructions suggest that you wipe the watchband after every use. That is easily done.\n",
            "The 1st one was so great! I had to order a 2nd one for someone else!!\n",
            "lOOKS GREAT!\n",
            "These watches are without a doubt cute, also they advised me it would take 4 weeks they came in less than two weeks, they can be worn with anything, and I will order again from them.\n",
            "This is a gift for a Doctor Who fan.  I couldn't find a true doctor who watch that wasn't plastic or wasn't going to break the bank.  When I saw this one it fit the bill.  And let me tell you - the pictures don't do it justice.  This is a gorgeous time piece,  He is going to love it.\n",
            "Love this Timex - a bit retro,\n",
            "The watch is OK for the money but the watch band broke within 2 weeks !!! The clasp was put together with a bendable piece used for attaching the watch to the band...so the clasp blew apart and parts went everywhere...could not find them all.  Live in an isolated area [hence the frequent purchases on line] so only one store in our town [25 miles from home/one way] has replacement bands and they don't have one to fit and the ones they do have cost as much as the watch and band.  Disappointing to say the least.\n",
            "I love this watch.\n",
            "I love this watch and band.  I get compliments on it as it is a little funky while still being preppy and practical.  I have had no problems with it and it lights up very brightly when in dark.  About to buy a new strap as it is looking worn out I wear it so much.\n",
            "Never want to take it off!\n",
            "Awesome watch. I have always loved Casio for their strong cheap multifunction watches. But this one is totally worth the price. It has a very accurate compass, worldtime, alarm, stop watch, etc. It looks great, it is water proof, it does look very resistant.<br />For anybody who might need to use the compass function, or just want a cool looking watch (multi-funtions too) I recommend it.\n",
            "ok\n",
            "The face of the watch is hard to read with the gray background.  Comfortable and looks good but can't really recommend.\n",
            "Nice watch\n",
            "I've had this watch for about a year now and this is my favorite watch I've ever owned--I get compliments all the time\n",
            "Digital # are nonreadsble goofey font and # are not readble.could not git chime on hour alarm or millitary time as well\n",
            "I bought the clock as a gift for my elderly mother. She really likes it. So far, it's keeping perfect time. Her only concern is that, without her hearing aids, it's harder for her to hear the alarm. I think it would be fine for anyone with normal hearing.\n",
            "Its the best watch I've ever owned and at age 75, there have been many. I've had it for a few years now.<br /><br />The only problem is its complexity. I need to carry printed instructions to make changes when traveling between time zones.<br /><br />The auto time update is a bit less sensitive than that for my prior watch. The prior watch watch (also a Casio) would update where ever it was in the house. This one needs to be placed in a window facing Colorado.\n",
            "Loving it so far.\n",
            "Beware. This watch is really big.\n",
            "It fit my big wrist right out of the box and looks good. Head not oversized it fits my wrist.\n",
            "First let me say: I really, really like this watch.<br />I was on the edge for a while because it was a mechanical watch and because of how small it was.<br />I typically wear the watch Sunday through Thursday and it sits on my dresser Friday and Saturday. Due to it being a mechanical watch that means that I have to &#34;wind&#34; the watch and reset the time when I put it back on Sunday morning.<br />That being the case, it's totally worth it to me. I really appreciate the mechanical action of the watch, and the fact that I never have to replace the battery.  I've put a nice leather band on it ([[ASIN:B009LHJJNC Hirsch 109002-70-18 18 -mm  Genuine Calfskin Watch Strap]]) and I think it looks great! I have smaller wrists and I think the scale of the watch works well.<br />The included nylon band is good quality and is comfortable, sometimes I'll switch back to it if I want a more casual look.<br />I love the detailing and design of the watch face, I'm thrilled to have something like this - especially for this price!\n",
            "Very nice and perfect watch!\n",
            "PERFECT\n",
            "Luv it!!!!!\n",
            "Great watch! I definitely recommend to anyone who likes wearing wrist gear! My only question is how do I turn on the LED light? I'm so confused but it's a great watch! It shipped fast and the battery works!\n",
            "It's great &better than the same watch with non-luminous face I purchased last year; that one works great too.\n",
            "It arrived and I was able to put my watch back back on so I guess it works.  My watch is that huge (42mm) but still had to use the biggest dies.  So if you have a bigger watch, this might not be big enough t cup the front crystal correctly.\n",
            "Good looking, fabulous price and works well!  Highly recommended!\n",
            "When I first received the watch I was very pleased with it until a week later the strap fell apart. I had to send it back I wish that didn't happen because I really like the watch. But the customers service was great.\n",
            "Love this\n",
            "Really nice - love timex...band is leather and the color is just like the picture\n",
            "I love the way it looks but it is too heavy for the band which kind of stretches and gets crooked on your wrist.  I am already down to the last hole.  I do not intend to return it, I'd rather try to work something out.  I would like to ask manufacturer why 4 on the dial is IIII and not the correct IV?  Watch with an error?\n",
            "excelent ballance between price and product.\n",
            "The alarm clock is in perefct size, this is exactly what i wanted. It's been 3 months from the delivery and the alarm clock works fine without any error.\n",
            "Great watch with amazing design features for the money!  I have only seen forged carbon case on watches costing around 17-25k.  This is my second Momo design watch in the series with the other on being all titanium. Great value and a solid Swiss movement. Too bad they are all sold out!\n",
            "Adjustment too complicated, several pages of instruction, too many for a watch, digital read out too small,<br />can barely read it. Should have sent it back.\n",

            "it doesn't work\n",
            "Real leather watchbands look awesome, but it doesn't take much sweat to make them smell terrible. This is the perfect compromise. It looks just like leather, and I've worn it a week now through hot weather and even swimming. No stink at all. Yes, the strap is thinner than some. Yes, the band is excessively long. But I've doubled the loose end back under the loops, which actually makes everything a bit more secure. The only minor quibble is that I had to punch an extra hole to make it fit my wrist.\n",
            "Really nice watch, the only thing is that is bigger than I expected\n",

            "The Armitron Sport Women's 45/7051CLR Digital Clear Jelly Strap Watch is flat out beautiful! I love watches for their looks as well as their performance, so I am as delighted with the look of this stylish watch as I am happy with its performance.<br />It is a perfect watch to wear when you are swimming laps, as you can time yourself using it. Even better, the dial is very visible in every detail so you won't have to stop or waste time looking at it when you are working out. You can see it easily!<br />It has a jelly strap so you have to expect somewhat of a sticky feel when you are wearing it on a hot summer day. I don't mind it, and it plays a part in the watch's cool look.<br />If it begins to bother you, just jump in the water wearing it--because that is part of the fun of it--you can, with no worries!<br />As a piece of jewelry, this watch will update your sporty style. It is a great wear alone piece, or would goes nicely with a simple sterling bracelet to accentuate and play up the lovely silver face.<br />I am delighted with the Armitron Sport Women's 45/7051CLR Digital Clear Jelly Strap Watch, and recommend it.\n",

            "Love it.\n",
            "It is too large for a women's watch and I do not see the option to remove a link so that it fits my wrist.\n",
            "My 21 year old son purchased this.  It looks good and the watch face is just the right size for his arm -- some watches look ridiculously oversized, and this one is tasteful and just right.\n",
            "i love it,\n",
            "It is just what I wanted for our newly remodeled bathroom.  The clear band allows the color of the wall to show through.  It's very attractive and seems to be good quality.\n",

            "Perfect for all sizes of watches ...\n",

            "So I hated the band on my Invicta Russian Diver, but I loved the band on another Invicta watch I had. It inspired me to go looking for another band and this is what I found. Ironically, when I got it I realized that it is identical to the band on the Invicta watch that I liked. I popped out the old band and even was able to switch the genuine Invicta hasp to the new band and now I love my Russian Diver.<br /><br />Great product, fast shipping.\n",
            "I wish it would have came with a few instructions. Over all it a good product. It took almost an entire month to get her which was less pleasing.\n",
            "Very nice everyday watch\n",
            "Its a timex, always works. Band could be a little larger.\n",

            "Superb watch... :)\n",
            "Good looking watch for the price. Only had it for a week  but it fits and works great. Like I said good quality and fit for a watch that costs less than $100.\n",
            "Excellent watch, very fancy\n",
            "This watch is perfect for me.. i use gloves in my workplace and this fits under it.. like the look, too.. although its lighter than what i expected it to be, but you can't go wrong with a watch this cheep and still looks good\n",
            "Purchased this to go with my Citizen Eco-Drive BM8180-03E watch. This is an awesome watch band. The silicone is soft yet durable. The clasp is stainless and probably worth $5 on it's own. You do need to trim the band to length but it's pretty easy to figure out. Buy 2 if you're scared. I also purchased a metal oyster style band to go with the watch and chose this one instead. It did take a couple weeks to arrive but I think it was well worth the wait.\n",
            "For $150 (at the time of purchase), I couldn't be happier.  I can't believe people pay upwards and excess of $300 for smartwatches (like the Apple Watch).  I particularly like the Moto 360 due to the rounded face.  I've been complimented on it a couple times and one of them was by a friend of mine who is a fashion major, so her opinion meant more to me than others.  When I first purchased this, I originally thought, &#34;smartwatches are stupid and a waste of money,&#34; but since Amazon said I could return it within 30 days if I didn't like it, I figured I might as well try it out so I stopped knocking smartwatches before I tried one.  I initially told myself I'd try it out for a bit even though I didn't really see the benefit of having it.  A week later, &#34;hmm...I don't like that I like this,&#34; haha.  Another week later, &#34;well, if I win $1000 at bingo next week, then I'll keep it.&#34;  Three days later, &#34;I'm going to keep it regardless of bingo,&#34; but I fortunately did end up winning the $1000 at bingo :)  I highly recommend it and I've never once had battery life issues like some people complain they have.\n",

            "Very good qualify\n",
            "the quality of the band is good,  but there are not attached instruction on how to adjust the band.  also it says that it is suppose to fit the Pebble watch.  it was very hard to get the band on to the watch because it was so tight and had to keep playing around to get the pins into the holes on the watch.\n",

            "Piece of junk. I bought it for my son based on the semi-positive reviews but it broke within a few hours of receiving it. I guess you get what you pay for. It's a really cheap watch but I thought it would last a little longer.\n",
            "MY BABYGIRL LOVE IT\n",
            "It feels very plasticky and is thicker than most every other band I have ever bought. Especially the two loops feel very plastic and cheap. Over all, it fits my watch (Bell & Ross Heritage Sport BR 123-92) well, but they are not the best watch straps I´ve ever bought.\n",
            "Love the mallet, love the holder.  The pin pushers are not the strongest.  Bent one pretty badly trying to size a Movado ceramic band (double barrel in that particular watch band).  Great pricing however so I'm still satisfied with this purchase.\n",

I mean I guess that's what you get for the price huh. I wouldn't waste your time on these. its just clutter on my table now. its completely useless. oh well. live and learn huh\n",

I have recommend him to all my friends and they are also very happy. This particular watch was a great gift for a dear friend.\n",

I would recommend getting an inexpensive spring pin tool as it takes a little effort to get olds ones out and new ones in without it. I'm rough on watches and I kept bending the 20mm X 1.5mm pins the local jeweler was putting in my band. These are the OEM size and quality (or better) used by Casio.\n",

So i spoke to the company i have to say they were noting but awesome and concerned over the issue and the resolved the issue for me and once i received the watch i loved it. I am here telling anyone who reads these reviews if you want a watch with weight and class on your arm this is the one for you !\n",
            "There are so many functions on this watch, I don't know where to begin!  It's waterproof, has a stopwatch function, alarm, date readout, light (pretty blueish light) and many more things I am sure I haven't even discovered yet.<br />It is very comfortable to wear, with the soft plastic band for a strap.  The only metal on this is the buttons you push in, the buckle and the gray thing around the face.<br /><br />But if the strap ever breaks, you will be out one useful watch, since it doesn't look like it would be easy to replace at all.\n",
            "Very fast shipping, the watch was easy to set and learn, I love it\n",
            "It's a wonderful watch. This is my first fossil watch and I wasn't expecting it to be this good! It's unbelievable how sturdy this watch feels. I think I could drop it from a 3 story building 100 times and it wouldn't break. It's a really heavy watch as you may have seen from others reviews on this watch but the chronograph works well. It resets well! The ONE thing I can think of that I would like changed is the second hand movement! I was kind of disappointed when I opened my package and saw this was a Quartz watch. If it had the constant movement as a mechanical watch, I would be in love with this watch and wear it forever. Can't get any better than a very expensive looking and feeling watch for the price of this one! Check these out used, and if you find one for cheap, I'd suggest getting it. The band will scratch up super easy so if you plan on wearing it, get a used one. If you plan on setting it up as a decoration, go for the brand new one. What the hell. It's a great watch for somebody who wants that expensive OMEGA style watch for really cheap. I honestly like this watch more than similar styled Rolex I got from my grandfather.\n",
            "Great watch. I have a men's Citizen of my own.\n",
            "Nothing like a Skagen. I have 4 and love them all.\n",
            "Be ware, this model looks more black than blue.  The bezel is black and the dial looks a deep dark blue only in bright light.  Victorinox does make this watch in a much brighter blue that I saw in a retail store.  I was disappointed with the color as I already have a black dial watch\n",
            "Looks and feel like quality, exactly as pictured.\n",
            "Excelent\n",
            "Great watch, only one problem, it took me forever to change the time, the instructions make no sense and you have to press the button extremely hard, my thumbs are blistered. Once I finally figured it out it was great and ready to use! One more problem.... You can't adjust it!\n",
            "This watch is amazing!<br />I absolutely love it and recommend it highly.\n",

            "slightly large.  had to trim thickness and the reliefs.  but after trimming it works great.\n",
            "Gorgeous watch. Unfortunately mine broke about a month after I got it. It would stop and start when I first got it, and I thought maybe I hadn't wound it enough. I had. Then a month in it didn't work at all unless it was face down. The seller told me to pay to send it in since its under warranty. Haven't gotten a chance yet. Annoyed I have to. Very disappointed this happened for the price. Also very loud. But very gorgeous.  Update: broke again less than a year after buying\n",
            "Item did not work after two months. I left it thinking that it was the battery but the Jewelry company wants to fix it because it is already broken. Well, I knew it was not going to be for a long term deal but as good as it looks?\n",
            "Looks good. Had to take three links off as I have small wrists. Easy to take the links off.<br /><br />Unfortunately the machine broke three weeks after I got it. Something apparently shifted internally and the second hand got permanently stuck. Luckily Kenneth Cole watches come with a lifetime warranty.\n",
            "Happy with the watch but the rubber watch band could be a little better. The band hasn't had any issues yet, but I am not sure about the durability in the long term.\n",

            "Great for every day swimmers\n",
            "Bought this to replace a Luminox I had for many years. So far it has been great. Did have to replace the band already but other than that it has been great.\n",
            "CHEAPLY MADE. First watch had to be replaced due to broken crown.  Replacement watch does not keep time and only runs sporadically.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.\n",
            "Nice watch for a small price\n",
            "Love this watch. Looks good and the big watch face is easy to read. As many other reviewers noted, the band seems shorter than normal, so might not fit large wrists.\n",
            "At first I was not impressed with this watch, but then I wore it out to a bar one night, and as I was picking up on a bartender, she said 'hey, that's a nice watch' and so now I think it was a good buy.\n",
            "This buckle was very easy to put on my watch band and saved me from having to toss out the band that was still in good shape!  It's nice to wear my watch again.\n",
            "Fogged up on me as soon as I went outside the first day, but it hasn't happened since. It tells time and looks great while doing it.\n",
            "Seems to be a strong sturdy watch so I am very satisfied at this point\n",
            "Expanded like crazy once it got wet. a good 2mm too big for my watch now. Not a stainless steel buckle as I can see brass through the silver finish. I have very small wrist - like 6.25in around and because the band expanded width wise when it got wet, it also shrunk length wise. That means I have the band completely maxed out and it still just barely fits on my wrists So anyone with normal wrists beware... This expansion also ruins the strap keeper part as the wide band doesn't fit well through it, resulting in even more bunching. I don't think this is actually perlon as other perlon straps I've owned haven't reacted this way to getting wet, It is also much less stiff than my other straps. Overall I am very frustrated by this product, especially at the price. The buckle is obviously not steel, which the seller MUST know, it is pretty obvious. Plus the strap is very poorly made, which may not be the sellers fault although it is still a bad product.\n",
            "A nice watch. But the battery died 3 months after it arrived\n",
            "Perfect fit, nice band, all the packaging and everything was correct. I am a huge Invicta fan this is a awesome watch with a great face size and doesn't weigh a ton. Would suggest to anyone looking for a nice watch.\n",

            "Watch was very nice. Any fireman would like it i think.\n",
            "One missing little crystal among so many really had a negative impact on this watch. i had to send it back the day after I received it..\n",
            "I got 2 seikos.  Solar and self-winding.  I charged solar while wearing it on Thursday and Friday most of the day.  I got self winding Friday late afternoon.  So I put it on.  It began to work.  Saturday morning I went to jeweler to shorten both watch bands.  Self winding was easy to remove the links.  I got it back and wore it rest of Saturday and Sunday morning.  I had to leave solar watch at jewelry until Max came in on Monday.  Sunday morning seiko self winding watch STOPPED working.<br /><br /> I just came home from the jewel.  Seiko Solar watch had correct time and was still functioning.  I guess the flourescent lighting really does work on the solar watches.<br /><br />Self winding is being returned.  Then I will use refund for another solar.\n",
            "Bought it as a gift for my girlfriend. For the price I paid I expected a better strap and watch overall. The watch face is very cheap and noticeable, and the strap is also clunky and not visually appealing. As a watch enthusiast with a multitude of watches in my wardrobe, this is not one I would ever wear. But I guess you get the price you pay.\n",
            "I ordered this in July 2015 from Dexclusive and the watch arrived with a potentially dead battery. I will need to bring this to a watch repairman to have the battery changed and hope that it is only a dead battery.\n",

            "My son loves his watch, he is 6 years old and this is his first watch. We actually set the alarm feature in the watch and he gets up really fast all by himself (this is huge as he would normally have to be sleep walked to the shower! He's a very deep sleeper!) so he's had the watch s week so far.<br />The strap is adjustable which is great. It has an alarm feature and timer feature plus it lights up in the dark with the press of a button. Awesome watch, now I hope the company makes more in different designs for girls and boys!!\n",
            "Wish it came with better instructions on exactly how to operate, but was able to locate a YouTube tutorial.  Good price for item.  Quick shipping.  Satisfied with purchase.\n",
            "This came with a watch band tool that was super useful. I purchased this for my LG Urbane smartwatch that is also stainless steel and this watchband matches it perfectly.\n",

            "Very nice watch\n",
            "So far, so good.  What I like best so far is the fact that my old eyes can read the date.  Black letters on a white background work!  Time is easy to read and lume good.\n",
            "Perfect watch\n",
            "Looks good and pretty cheap. Made thinly and feels like it could be cheaper, but its only a 13$ watch so not too bad.\n",

            "fun but smaller than i thought as far as the fit of the ring its a little tight\n",
            "The watch is cute, it has all the helpful markers to teach kids how to learn.  My issue with it is when it first arrived and we peeled the protective plastic coating off the watch face, it wasn't centered and it took all the numbers on the top of the outer watch ring off.  My son was very disappointed, he doesn't have 50, 55, 60, 5 or 10 listed anymore and it was brand new!  Addendum:  The watch face broke less than a week after the time that it is no longer eligible for return so I have no remedy and my son has no watch.  I'd look elsewhere for a decent timepiece for a child.\n",
            "Really high quality, came with appropriately sized posts. Highly recommend this seller.\n",
            "I am very happy with this timepiece.  It is in my opinion quite accurate for a mechanical movement.  I have carefully checked and it loses fifteen seconds per day or a minute every four days.  It has a classic easy-to-read face, a nice bracelet and the appearance of a more expensive watch.<br />If you are considering an automatic movement watch you can't go wrong with the Seiko SNKK65.\n",

Unfortunately, the watch is flimsy and has a very cheap feel to it.  The watch band is plastic and does not feel strong at all.  In fact, the watch feels like a plastic toy watch to me.

            "Well, it's not an expensive watch and I don't know what the longevity will be but it's very comfortable and had big numbers and letters. I purchase one of these, or like it every couple of years. When they get scratched or the strap gets ragged a bit I order a new one. On other watches like this the time isn't much of an issue but the day of the week is usually tiny. This one has the time/date/day of the week all there without having to push a button. The light is kind of nice too. The black numbers turn blue when the button is pushed. The dial is big but for some reason doesn't feel or look big as it seems to integrate with the strap. The velcro strap is more comfortable than other ones I've used.<br /><br />If it should give up the ghost earlier than I'd like I'll return and let you know.\n",

If keep watch longer than 2025 the add 10 years when dial loops back to 2016+.\n",
            "Second time I've had this watch after the first one craped out, it happens. Great military watch (does military time too), great quality, looks great and super easy to program w/o instructions. Water proof so I don't take it off in the shower, and take off at night. No signs of wear on watch strap and is sturdy enough I do not expect it for a long time.\n",

There was no plastic part keeping the dial out from watch face so I'm not sure if it's a lack or that or if faulty packaging :(<br />Disappointed in not being able to wear it right away- my reason for buying online has always been convince and now I've have to make TWO trips. First to get links taken out-easy enough and a given for my small wrist, and now to get a battery.  Can't help thinking the worst- was this a returned item? When they open it what will be the state of the battery?? Corroded? Gumming up the whole watch??\n",

            "I've wanted a Swatch since I was 18 and recently needed a watch, so I went for it.  Shipping was extra fast and I received the product within 2 days.  What looks like a navy color online is actually a dark purple, and I feel like they have the pink colors switched online, but it could just be the lighting effect.  You might be able to tell what I mean from the pictures I posted.  Even though, I love the way the watch look, I guess I don't understand why it arrived ticking.  Makes me wonder how long the battery will last.  On that note, the ticking is quite loud so I keep my watch in the LR if I'm not wearing it, that way, we can sleep at night.  The real reason why I'm only giving this product 3 stars, is that within 2 days of wearing it, I had 3 major scratches appear on the face plate.  You might be able to see them on the 2nd picture I posted, they look like 3 white lines.  This is Swatch so I really expected this item to be made of durable material that would last me the next 10yrs and unfortunately, I'm finding out the hard way that name brand or not, it's just cheap plastic afterall....  I still like the watch and will be keeping it because, well...  I always wanted a Swatch...\n",

It looks just like leather, and I've worn it a week now through hot weather and even swimming. No stink at all. Yes, the strap is thinner than some. Yes, the band is excessively long. But I've doubled the loose end back under the loops, which actually makes everything a bit more secure. The only minor quibble is that I had to punch an extra hole to make it fit my wrist.<br /><br />Note: [[ASIN:B010EMO9MS The original Amazon listing]] I bought this through is unavailable now, but this appears to be the same product.\n",

            "The strap looks better in person and the curved springbars add an extra contured look that dresses up any watch, specially my Seiko Alpinist.  The one fault has to be the deployant clasp, while easy to work and fits perfectly to the strap, it fell apart this morning by suprise??? I was wearing the watch (my Seiko) and i heard a small piece of metal hit the ground and when i bent down to look for it another piece of metal hit the ground to be followed by my watch! It appears the someway the two small deployant buttons popped off??? I do not see how the buttons popped out as they are secured by two springs? I fit everything back together and wore the watch all day with no problems.  I just dont know what happened?  I dont know if it is a common thing, but i have been wearing the band for the last few weeks with no problem.  If it comes apart again i will just swap the deployant with a buckle no problem.  It still is a very sharp looking strap which i recommend.  Just keep an eye on your deployant parts.\n",

            "This is a very nice watch.  It looks as good and works as well as a Citizens or any other well known brand.  Actually I would say it looks better than any of the other brands I saw at the jewelers when I was looking. I was looking at other watches when I brought this one into the jewelers to get it sized and no other looked better.  I like the one I bought more. If you are reading this you are most likely looking to purchase something.  Many of these Invicta watches are huge in size so make sure you check out the size chart for both diameter size and thickness size.  When I say some are huge that may be an understatement.  This watch was the smallest of this type Invicta that I saw - which is the main reason I picked this one.  Even this watch is a good size in diameter and thickness as well as heavy compared to a timex or watch of that type. And, unless you have wrists the size of an Ape you'll need to get it sized.  I needed to have three links taken out. That process is somewhat painless for a jeweler.  It only took him a couple of minutes and charged me $5.00.  Good luck in picking out something!  You can't go wrong with this brand.  Oh - it comes in a really, really nice double box to keep it in.  Classy act there.\n",
            "The side knob fell off after two days. Have to return for credit. Bummer. My child really liked it.\n",
            "watch is ok. When you open the box it has very plush packaging with multiple layers. The watch is ok for the price you pay. The band is really cheap/thin and am afraid it may break. The crown and protection around it is plastic and doesn't feel super stable. You have to adjust time every so often as it lags.  I feel like if they would have put half the quality and money into the watch as they did the packaging it would probably be a decent product. Overall ok watch for casual wear, do not think it would stand up to everyday wear.\n",

            "I previously owned a Seiko solar watch that was all black. It worked for about 4 years, and then one day the stem knob fell off (no trauma that I could remember) and the second hand froze. Up until that time, I had no problems and had numerous comments regarding the way the watch looked. As I recall, that watch cost ~$200 but I got it on sale for ~$50 at a local department store. It was a reliable timepiece and withstood accidental swimming pool and shower exposure until its unexplained sudden death. I sent it in and the Seiko service center wanted $125 to repair it. NOW I have this one, and my review reflects only 1 week of use. GREAT - love the look which is as elegant as the old one. No idea yet about durability, but it started working immediately upon light exposure. The day/date is large enough to read without my reading glasses (barely) and definitely better than the old one. The strap is calf leather, thick and will likely not wear out. All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and the discounted Amazon price, but it is early times. Also, probably due to my own error in clicking twice on my wish list or similar, Amazon sent out TWO watches. I returned one and I must say that the Amazon return process is flawless - the best consumer experience ever!\n",

            "Gorgeous watch!  I feel rich when I wear it.  The only negative I would have is that it is very large and as I have a very small wrist, I couldn't get is sized as small as I would have liked.  It's too bad companies don't make jewelry for small wrists.\n",

Read the manual, there are a lot of neat functions!\n",

I was given a few watch batteries, which is welcomed, but I don't want to deal with the hassle of paying to get a battery installed in a supposedly &#34;new&#34; watch. It was smaller than I expected, so it went to 4 stars. But, once I found it wasn't working at all, it dropped to 1 star. Now I'm gonna have to pay to get a battery installed...(not happy).\n",

            "Super cute, but quality is low. Worn only once or twice and Knob on the side is completely missing so I cannot adjust the time of the watch. It stops or slows and messes up the time.\n",

            "Good\n",
            "Huge fan of this watch! I got a wedding band that is a combination of white gold and rose gold, and the watch compliments it nicely.<br />For the price, I feel that the quality is outstanding. It fits comfortably and has gotten a lot of compliments in the short time that I've had it, and few times that I've worn it.\n",
            "Nice watch for the money, first. Curren watch I own and I am very happy with it, and planning to start my collection.\n",

            "Nice watch. I love the design on it is not as glamorous as it is on the Amazon website though. But it comes Ina ridiculously large size and you have to take it to a Watch repair to fix the bands which is roughly another twenty dollars so…\n",
            "Very elegant everything looks and works good ...good for the price you cannot beat it...if you haven't got one get one!!\n",
            "Too big and clasp very difficult to open. Decent movement though. Worth a hundo, but wouldn't pay more.\n",
            "Everything I expected. Very elegant and sexy watch.\n",
            "Watch is much smaller than I had anticipated.  The band is plastic.  Some bands are plastic, but appear leatherlike.  Not this one.  It's plastic.  Can't  complain for the price and I probably should have have been more careful about reading the description.\n",
            "It's perfect for my watch.  I didn't notice sizing on it, but I have a small wrist and it fits fine.<br />Can't remember if it mentioned length or not, but if you wrist is not small it might not work.\n",

            "I received the Casio DBC32D-1A DataBank (25 Telememo, Calculator Watch) in 7 days from Beverly Hills, CA. This is the 6th Casio Data Bank Watch that I have owned including DBC610-A (50 Telememo, Calculator Watch) and DBC1500-B1 (150 Telememo, Calculator Watch) all with Chrome Cases and Stainless Steel Bands. I selected the Casio DBC32D-1A DataBank as the closest substitute replacement for the DataBank 150, which has been out of production for some time. The DataBank 150 is still fully functional and wearable as a casual daily wear watch over about 20 years; I have repaired the broken watch case to keep the band connected about 3 times and re-batteried at least 3 times. The new Data Bank is NOT a close substitute for the DataBank 150… the only feature that is better is the larger LCD Display with Bolder Fonts and 3-line display, but not at the expense of sacrificing all of the other great feature functions, which make the DataBank Calculator Watch practical and sensible! I have no problem with the low 25 Telememo capacity since I have owned a Mobile/Cell Phone, (which has nearly unlimited telememo capacity, etc.) for as long as I have owned my current DataBank 150, but I like the advantage of being able to access my DataBank info when I am on my Mobile Phone. The watch is not metalized in a Chrome Finish like the other DataBanks but is painted in a stainless steel finish, which matches the Stainless Steel Brushed Band but will not be as durable! The Telememo Name Line only has 8 characters, which only 3 are view-able at a time while scrolling and is difficult to identify the Data Record by Name (the same problem we had with early computers) and the 2nd number line is numerical only. You cannot continue to identify the record name, etc. unless you use a number code and the line is not even long enough to contain a telephone number with only 8 number spaces and the 3rd line has only 7 number spaces in a small font size half the size of the 2nd line, which is just dumb…This designs 2nd line can only be used to display the Country and/or Area Code usually 3 to 5 numbers of the 8 available and you must use to continue with the key number on the 3rd line in the very small font with 7 spaces in groups of 3 and 4 spaces! In comparison if you are not familiar with the other DataBank Watches, there are two lines with the first line 9 spaces for Alpha/Numerical and the last 4 spaces for numerical as in country and area code. You can continue your number display on the 2nd last line 8 use-able spaces with a hyphenated number all in the same size and width font making viewing and readability easier! It is also much more time consuming and difficult to input data by having to scroll through the entire Alpha/Numerical/Symbols list one character at a time to make your selection vs. using the keypad to select between 3 or 4 Alpha/Numerical/Symbols as with most keypad programming! The Illuminator Name on the Watch Case is a carry over from the Blue Electro-Luminance Back Lighted LCD of the DataBank 150/300, which provides a good even lighted view when needed in dim light and/or dark of night at a low current draw. The new DataBank 25 Illuminator has only a single white/yellowish LED that lights up very unevenly from the lower left corner of the LCD display. These are the main features that were comprised in the new DataBank 25 design that I do not like. To provide features like 5 alarms, which you do not need more then 2 alarms, a (dual) 2 time displays provided (vs. no World Time Clock with all time zones), no count down timer, but continue to offer Stop Watch, Currency Converter and Calculator. The watch will support 13 Languages which is an over kill vs. world zone marketing, again at the expense of sacrificing practical and usable features. I can now understand why the Casio DataBank 150 and 300 Telememo, Calculator Watches are selling for more then five (5) times their original cost. I will keep this watch but it is not the value that I expected. I will continue to use my DataBank 150 until it is no longer operational… it does not have much of the chrome finish left but I can remove the chrome like I have done before and refinish by Silver Painting and Brushing the S.S. Band to match the new watch color.<br />I have since restored the approximately 20-year-old Casio DBC 1500 after searching through a dozen Silver Metallic Paint colors. I selected the Rust-Oleum Appliance Epoxy 7887 Stainless Steel as the closest match to the Casio S.S. Paint Finish @ $3.74 http://www.amazon.com/Rust-Oleum-7887830-Appliance-12-Ounce-Stainless/dp/B0009XB3JU/ref=pd_bia_nav_t_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=168YAQ50HFMXY2DHTGY8.  The epoxy finish is slow to cure but a very hard and durable finish, which I buffed / brushed the finish with medical gauze.\n",
            "good\n",
            "Very good\n",
            "I ordered this watch as a gift for my 19-year-old son, and couldn't be more pleased with it. It's a much &#34;classier&#34; watch than what he's worn before, more suitable for an adult than the plastic or faux-leather styles he's worn in the past. I love the natural patterns in the wood and the carved details. On the back of the watch face, all the information (such as the Bewell logo) is actually carved right into the wood. The wood is very, very smooth, with no rough edges that might catch on your skin or clothing. It's also listed as water resistant (although not waterproof), which is a must-have when gifting a watch to a young adult.<br /><br />This is a larger watch (about two inches diameter across the face of it), so while it looks a little oversized on my scrawny little girly wrist (pictured), it's a good size for a man's watch. Despite that, it's incredibly lightweight. The band itself is adjustable up to about 8.5 inches around (in comparison, my wrist is 7 inches). The description states that you can easily make the band smaller by removing joints from the strap – I haven't tried to do this myself yet, but it looks like it would be relatively simple to do. The clasp on the watch is unique – one end fits to the other like a puzzle piece, with magnets in both ends to hold them together.<br /><br />The packaging of this watch is also quite nice, ready for gifting. The watch wraps around a cushioned velvety pillow inside of a sturdy black cardboard box; the lid of the box has a plastic &#34;viewing window&#34; that displays the watch inside. And the cardboard box comes inside of a clear plastic box for extra protection.<br /><br />This is a very attractive watch, and I would love to get one of the more feminine styles for myself now that I've seen the beauty and craftsmanship of this particular design!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.\n",
            "Look closely at the picture. Not a true nato Zulu as described. It's attached to itself in one too many places, making for a poor fit and odd appearance. There's at least one ring that just sits outermost the strap without being used. Silly.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the leather is definitely a plastic joke.<br /><br />Skip this one for sure.\n",
            "It's very nice I love it so much.<br />I recommend this watchs from this store.<br />Sure I will buy more.<br />Thanks for you my friend.\n",
            "Rugged construction, built to last, perfect fit.  Moisture wicking polyester fabric keeps you cool and dry, even in Florida heat.\n",
            "Perfect!!!  Gray was the same shade as pictures\n",
            "very very nice watch.\n",
            "Great watch. Worn one for years. A classic.\n",
            "the watch looks amazing, have a nice weight, well made, the band is really soft and feels durable, looks incredibly sealed the case, i'm very happy, this watch accomplish all my expectations.\n",
            "Purchased the watch in April of this year. It came quickly and was beautiful out of the box. I've owned Invicta watches in the past and they generally last a couple of years. I'm rather hard on watches. I didn't keep the box since I thought I would never need it. That was my first mistake. After two weeks the watch stopped working. The hands inside the watch actually came loose from the center stem. I was getting close to my 30 day return with Amazon and realized I didn't have the box to return it in. I thought no biggie, I'll send it to Invicta since it was under a year warranty. I paid $87 for the watch. In order to use the warranty you have to send them a check for $28.00 to cover shipping and insurance plus pay for the postage to return the watch. That doesn't sound like much of a warranty. I sent the watch in for repair in the middle of May and they sent me an estimate for repair charges of $81.75. I called them and explained it was under warranty and I had sent in the information. They said okay I wouldn't have to pay the repair charges but they would have to send it off to be fixed. It is now August 25. I called today to check on my watch. Apparently it was sent overseas to be repaired hence the $28 for shipping and insurance. The anticipated date of return is September 22nd. That's a total of 4 months that I've been without a watch.  I will NEVER purchase another Invicta product again. Not only is their product inferior, but if you do have a problem they are not in any hurry to make it right.\n",
            "Had the watch for a couple of weeks and noticed condensation under the plastic face. Now I have 3 small rust spits on the dial and have not worn it since. Not happy with purchase.\n",

            "Bought it as a gift. I'm sure she will love it.\n",

            "Works Wonderfully! I tried just about everything to close the back of my watch, even tried tips from YouTube. Nothing worked until I received this Press. Highly recommended!\n",

            "very good  like it\n",
            "This watch does not feel very high quality when you actually get it. It looks great in the pictures, though.The thermometer was way off when I got it. The instruction book recommends that you calibrate it using something else. However, that seems kind of ridiculous to me. I plan on returning this watch.\n",
            "Very nice watch!!\n",
            "Watch faded quickly! Wouldn't prefer this watch at all.\n",
            "It's a bit too loose the person I bought it for has a slim hand.  And the watch has no adjustments.  However it's a very nice watch aesthetically.  It came 28 days ahead of schedule.  Overall I'm pleased. The person thinks it costs alot.  It's a pocket friendly watch.  Who doesn't like to save money.\n",
            "It's a good watch, but the chronograph is a bit big for my wrist.  I feel as though I am wearing the tachometer out of a 70's trans-am on my wrist.\n",

Please check the product using a little more nervous.\n",
            "It fits my Apple Watch Sport 42mm . I bought the Apple Watch band strap adapter that will be needed. The leather band is not too thick and stiff as it may look like. It is flexible and after a week of use it feels very comfortable. I have to cut a 5 cents diameter to allow the sensors to see my skin .\n",

            "Just received my order of this watch, which took over 10 days to receive. Now, the good. It looks great, the band is nice, and the band is comfy.<br /><br />The bad for me. It is heavy, and, unlike a few watches I own of similar size, it ends up rubbing my wrist bone because of where the strap points are. That's me. You might like it.<br /><br />Here's my real problems: according to the on-line manual, the battery will need to be replaced in two years. You can get that long with a regular battery. Most solar watches should last about 10 years. According to an email reply from Shark, the manual means it can last 2 years with charging. There are other contradictions in the manual, though.<br /><br />More ominous, the manual states &#34;Direct exposure to the sunlight will cause the watch overheat at the surface&#34;. What? It's a solar watch. Shark told me &#34;you don't need to put the watch under the blazing sun for quite a long time.&#34; What is a long time? I'm very concerned when I read about a solar watch overheat in the sunlight.<br /><br />So, it's going back.\n",

Three caveats, though: The contrast between the numerals and background is not nearly as marked as the photo makes it seem, so if you want a fast read, going with an Easy Reader model may be wise; the background color of the dial seems essentially black, not brown (as other reviewers have noted); and the strap is pretty cheap and merits replacement.

Green is not consistently dark throughout the strap as pictured, several shades lighter in the grain, and especially the keepers. Teju is of very high quality, and the strap should be listed as flat or very lightly padded. This is likely new old stock as I believe Speidel is out of business for several years now. Marked Austria, so may be made by Hirsch factory and rebranded. Unique color is a nice variation for my watch collection, but this wouldn't be a primary choice if you own less than a handful of watches or change straps often.  I have it on a 50s era Benrus 3 star and it enhances the vintage look.\n",

When I called customer service they said the warranty only covers the inside workings of the watch. A pin that breaks in 5 months is defective. I should not have to pay them to fix it!\n",

            "The watch has an excellent look for being so cheap, but it makes sense that the watch is so cheap because after two days of wear the clasp broke.\n",
            "The quality is very good.  There is a tab to prevent the strap from coming out of the loop that works too well; it is a minor struggle to pull the strap out of the loop when removing the watch.  Maybe it was just me, but I had a devil of a time getting one of the pins into the hole; the hole for the pin in the strap seemed to me to be machined a fraction of a mm off, making it difficult to get the pin to &#34;spring&#34; into position.  I would not begin replacing this strap, which is more difficult to replace due to Timex' original design, without special watch tools available in many inexpensive watch tool kits.\n",

I have been very pleased with this watch, no issues. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it too. It's very comfortable, and water resistant. I've swam with it with no issues. I also wash a lot of dishes. I like that it dries fast. I expect it to last a long time!\n",

            "This is may first Swiss Legend Watch.  I do admit, I like collecting watches as they are my only form of Jewlery ;)<br />As much as technology has marched forward, it seems analog watches are still as popular as ever, strange, huh... all those mechanicals never got replaced by high tech electronics.<br /><br />The packaging and storage case is superb, so are the instructions.  Although, I don't use a watch for much, other than glancing at it and telling time.  But if you like all the twist dials and small inner timers, this watch will not disappoint.  While a few other reviewers mentioned this watch is too large for most men... I would somewhat agree...while I prefer a large face dial, this one is adequate, but its the thickness makes it quite the beast on your wrist.  And it has some weight as well.... its noticeable.  So, for those sensitive to heavy watches or watches that &#34;stand out&#34; due to size, this is not a good fit for you.<br /><br />Time setting was a little different, but the instructions take you through it... I did try to experiment with the inner dials, and they are too small for me to see well... the date is small as well.  The blue tint in person, is NOT as strong as the picture suggests, it has a very slight blue tint, noticeable, but not overwhelming.... a nice touch IMO.<br /><br />When you look at this watch, at first glance to the average person who is not a watch enthusiast, it can be mistaken for a watch MUCH more expensive... as those watch enthusiasts know, similar looking watches can cost thousands.  The best switch watches today cost over 6 digits!  So, I would surely say it passes the bling test, if that is what you are after!  And at this price point, that says a lot.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice watch for the price, IF, you like em big n heavy and a want bling on your wrist.  Its not for everyone for sure... but a LOT of watch for the dollar....\n",
            "I've had this watch for almost 2 months, and my only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner. I'm just amazed as to how beautiful it is in person. It's just the perfect size, accentuating one's wrist while never overpowering it. The round section in the center with the pattern design adds a very nice distinction and flair. The transparent back showing the watch's inner mechanism is just cool, no other way to describe it. And the dark brown handcrafted leather band adds a final appeal to it, and what's more, it doesn't require much breaking-in. At first glance it's obvious that this is a very high quality watch, and if properly cared for and maintained, will give you many years of use.<br /><br />But as aesthetically nice-looking as this watch is, it wouldn't be worth owning if it didn't maintain accurate time, an issue that's present in many lower-priced automatics. I have tested this watch's time-keeping ability against my battery-powered watch, and it has passed the test with flying colors. Not once have I had to re-set the time, which I needed to do literally weekly with a Kenneth Cole automatic I bought recently (needless to say, I no longer have that one).<br /><br />A quick note about winding. If your intent is to wear this watch regularly then you should have no issues. But if you plan on not wearing it for days at a time, or even longer intervals, I'd suggest investing in an electrical winder so that it will be ready to go for you whenever you want. I'm no watch expert, but I don't think it's a good idea to just let it stop and then re-set the time over and over again, as that would surely place excessive and unnecessary wear & tear on the crown.\n",
            "Large, heavy watch. Feels sturdy and rugged.  My only complaints are that the digital seconds and the analog seconds are not in sync and after 24 hours are off sync by 5 seconds.  My other complaint is that the lower left button controls the change of digital time by pressing it normally three times in a row, so if I accidentally bump the watch, I'm frequently in time change mode.\n",
            "Update.  I must have gotten a junker. Sent it back and requested another one.  This one is great.  Perfect for sailing.  Barometer is right on (within 2 hours) and the moon phase is accurate.  Still need to adjuct the altimeter.\n",
            "Love this watch.  Very high end look, designed in Italy, made in Switzerland and for the price a steal.  Perfect size, comfortable fit and gives Cartier Tank a run for the money.\n",

            "This watch appears to be very expensive, its light in size, and stunning to look at.  Sometimes, we just cannot afford a nice watch, so there is nothing wrong with one less expensive.\n",
            "This is the worst watch I have ever owned.  About a month after purchase, I was sitting on the sofa and as I rose, it fell off my wrist.  One end of the strap had fallen out of its holder.  As I tried to reinsert it manually, one side of the holder broke off from the rest of the watch.\n",
            "This is a easy to read  watch because of it's size and backlight . The band length may be the only drawback for some.\n",
            "The watch dimensions are expressed accurate in the description. Its a very nice looking watch. This watch could easily be mistaken to be much more expensive. It has a classy look to it and goes with almost any outfit. The leather band is nicely made and seems as though it will last some time. There is no date. There is military time and a timer. Cheers!\n",
            "Nemesis has progressively made this watch more cheaply over the years.  The one pictured demonstrates how it looked when I got it the first time, and it included a higher quality leather band.  The second time, all the indented curly-q embellishments on the face on the face of the watch were gone and the weight that is supposed to wind the watch continually got stuck after a few months, and the third time, all the issues with the second watch were still there AND the leather band was mediocre, being poorly dyed (looking like it was paint brushed) and the prongs of the buckle were made out of cheap flat metal rather than the stronger, solid bar of metal the first two were made of.  SHAME on this company for sacrificing so much of the quality of this product to save a few dollars.\n",
            "It's an awesome gift and my friend loves it very much!!  Compare with China, the price is half.\n",
            "I've had this band on my Seiko for a little over a month and it is already falling apart. It is a shame because the band looked beautiful when I got it and still looks pretty good right now except for the stitching on the side that is coming undone. I've worn it every other day just to classes and such, so it hasn't taken much of a beating yet the quality of the band is not great. I'm severely disappointed as it looked great with my watch and was hoping it'd last much longer, you are better off buying a cheaper band for equal quality or spending a little more on a longer lasting band. I have included a picture of where the band split so potential customers can see for themselves.\n",
            "love it\n",
            "It is a basic time machine, it ha just a melody to wake up but it works.\n",
            "I really like this watch, but the two problems are that the strap is a little on the short side, meaning that it comes undone from the little holder rather regularly. Not all the time, though, but if it were a little longer, it'd be perfect. And I have normal size wrists.<br />The bigger problem is that the hands on the face are white against white. My vision is still very good, but I still find it difficult to see the time if I'm not in bright light. I don't mind using the watch's light, but it seems silly to HAVE to use it just because of a design flaw.<br />Other than those two things, it's great.\n",
            "For a first generation smartwatch, it's perfect.\n",
            "I love this pocket watch. It is so beautiful. I think it might not last SUPER long because I have children who play with the release, but it was so inexpensive, I will probably just order another one.\n",
            "I got this form my significant other's 30th birthday. It looks exactly like the picture and it looks awesome on him.\n",
            "I bought this watch as a gift for my wife.  Within 2-3 months, the arm band turned light grey and no longer matches the white color on the face of the watch (around the silver).  Also, the silver face of watch just also fell off (at 8 mths - after I gave it to her) and condensation has formed under the glass.  The watch was purchased less than one year ago.  She loved it at first, and wears it every day.  We just had a new baby, so she hasn't even worked out as much as normal/had the watch out in the elements.  I can only imagine that if you were wearing it for it's true purpose (working out), it would have broken down even faster. Very disappointing!\n",
            "This is a beautiful watch, I bought it for my husbands birthday. He likes unique watches and I thought this was something he didn't have. The first watch we received was not keeping time correctly and we figured out how to change the battery. Once we changed it the watch still did not keep time correctly, I contacted the company and they replaced the watch quickly and efficiently. So far the new watch has kept time great. I am excited for him to be able to wear this more often.\n",

The stem did not move the hands forward or back.  Nothing worked.  I promptly got a refund and set this one back.  I did not want to take the risk on another.

            "This is an attractive watch, and the wood makes it quite unique. It works well and is lightweight on my wrist.  The leather is fairly stiff at first, but should soften up over time.  The white color may show dirt easily (the nature of anything in white), but the leather should be able to be wiped clean without a problem.  If I could make a few improvements to this watch, I would prefer the Woodies logo to stand out less (perhaps be white or a darker 'wood' color), and also for there to be a few numbers for ease of telling time (12, 3, 6, & 9), or simply marks where those numbers are. I think the black & gold version of this watch has those features, so I'm not sure why this one is different.  Otherwise, I would definitely give it 5 stars!  (If I could do over again, I'd order the black & gold version since the design seems to suit me better- I still might so that I have both styles). As a note, I received this watch at a discounted price for my honest review.\n",

We were able to put it back in. A couple of days later, my husband wore the watch golfing, which seemed reasonable since it's a &#34;sport watch.&#34; While swinging his golf club, the pin in the strap came loose again and the watch flew off his wrist. The pin fell off in the process and was lost. I would also offer that this watch is pretty big, even on a man's wrist.\n",

I then put it into my pocket and walked about 20 feet and pulled it out to show my girlfriend and, according to the watch, nearly 4 hours had passed. Just as a test, I then took note of the displayed time and placed the watch gently in my pocket. I immediately pulled it out and 2 hours had passed. So it would appear that this watch helps you travel in time. I should give it to my friend so he could go back in time to before he spent his money on this junk.\n",
            "Love the larger face!\n",
            "The timepiece itself is actually very good quality, however, the band is a bit lower quality, it's not peeling or separating yet, but I can see that it is on the way of doing so.  Not a huge deal when wearing but when off, it will separate.  But overall, very happy. Especially for price.\n",
            "watch pin bracket broke immediatley.  returned it before ever using.\n",
            "I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend, and she loves it! The picture honestly doesn't do the watch justice. The quilted face of the watch is always catching the light from different angles, so it kind of always looks like it's subtly sparkling. I was worried the the gold frame might be a bit gaudy but the neutral color of the band really tones it down. The watch has a quality weight to it without being heavy, which is good because she has small wrists. All in all, it's a fantastic watch, and you can't beat the price.\n",
            "This is my second Seiko solar watch.  The only thing wrong with the first one is that I was tired of it and wanted one a little &#34;dressier&#34;.  One of my friends liked mine so well she bought an identical one.  I would recommend this item to anyone looking for good value and reliability.\n",
            "This was a waste of my money.\n",
            "nice\n",
            "WAS DELIVERED ON TIME BUT DIDNT WORK! NO INSTRUCTIONS.<br />DIDNT SEEM TO BE WORTH THE SMALL PRICE.<br />RETURNED IT.\n",
            "Arrived in Midwest 11days after purchase (faster than expected). Lume on hands better than expected, no lume on dial. Strap better than expected. One of the subdials is a 24hr clock (at 4pm it would point to &#34;16&#34;).  Only drawback is questionable water resistance and I wouldn't swim with it. At this price most of the money must go to shipping. Nice fashion watch.\n",
            "I like it\n",
            "Beautiful watch with a very poor band. The face is very nice, great details on the numbers. This is a bug hunk of metal, which I love but its very heavy and very thick. Mine runs a touch fast, but I'm fine with hit. For an entry level Swiss Auto, it's is a great addition to any collection. The case back is cool, but ultimately a non-factor for me.<br /><br />The band is bad, just bad. Broke in the first 2 weeks. I don't think it was meant for long term use, more like a placeholder until you put you own band on. I'm switching over to a NATO nylon strap since this is my casual watch.<br /><br />Definitely a great buy at this price, plan on replacing the band.\n",
            "I tried repeatedly to set the watch in the time zone that I live in without success!!! The digital read out is not aligned correctly on the watch!! Tried repeatedly to contact the sender without success!! I will never ever order anything from them again. I respect Amazon tremendously and I have never experienced an item like this one! Awful product! 12\n",
            "I was extremely pleased with the watch winder.  It has a very nice blue light which is not bothersome when it lights up at night.  It made a great gift and works well for winding the watch.\n",
            "WORST WATCH EVER!! Poor Quality. It changed color in less than 48 hours. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE BUY! The wait to get it was longer than the amount of time before the watch changed colors\n",

            "The face was much smaller than I expected\n",
            "Nice watch. Comes on a dark grey which might throw off some looking for the darker color that the picture shows but I thoight it looks better in the gun metal color it comes in. Functions well and is a good everyday watch for a bargain\n",

            "This product arrived with one of the battery caps off and I have tried several times to put it on, I now must take it to the shop which will cost me not happy. This is my first issue with this vender and I have purchased many items all with no problems.\n",
            "So, this watch is really pretty an all but it stopped working after a day. Unfortunately it doesn't look like you can take it apart to change the battery.. But it was really cheap so ya get what ya pay for\n",

            "I had to return this because of broken strap.\n",
            "Even more impressive in person!\n",
            "Great watch.  Have had it for a few months now. Gotten a lot of compliments.  The orange textured side is amazing as one reviewer pointed out and was nice enough to include a picture showcasing it.  It is a big watch with fairly solid heft to it(which I like) but I know some dislike large watches.  Main downside is that it's fairly useless to read when it's dark resulting in downgrade of one star, as there have been many a time I couldn't read it.  Really wish it had a light button.\n",

            "Chunky but lightweight wood watch feels and looks awesome!<br />Received several admiring comments from people on my first wearing!<br />I really like this natural alternative to the hightech Apple watch :)<br />my only concern is the clasp, that can be a little tricky to open/close\n",
            "Exactly as described. Gorgeous watch and arrived fast!\n",
            "I like the watch very much, but not in love with the stretch band.\n",
            "I purchased this watch with great anticipation.  For the price, the watch has everything you need for hiking without GPS.  The only problem is that it is extremely difficult to read the digital display.  The units are very small and become washed out with the background. I returned the unit and purchased a similar Casio with a contrasting background; black numbers on a white back ground.\n",

            "I purchased this watch to replace a 3-4 year old Armitron watch of roughly same features and appearance.  The old watch's wristband had broken and I figured it was time for a replacement.  The new watch is exactly as expected.  It keeps great time, has all the features needed, is waterproof, and looks very nice on my wrist.  No one is going to mistake it for a Rolex, but that's not why I bought it. Great value too.\n",
            "Watch looked great online - band us a bit flimsy.\n",
            "As an 83 yr old senior, I had great difficulty with the clasp so I mailed it back to Burei.\n",
            "Had this watch 1 week before the battery died.....\n",
            "This watch is just what I wanted - The face is large enough to easily see, setting it was a snap - the directions were straight forwarded.  The band is something - it is a little large for me, fits well and feels OK on my wrist. I'd by another one just like it if I lost this one. Blessings, Richard\n",
            "Thin and light as I wanted.  Also quite a large dial.  Seems to be on time.  Looks pretty elegant.  I am used to cheap watches, as I just want to know the time.  Still, this one does not look cheap.\n",
            "great condition\n",
            "Really nice simple watch.Doesn't come with much features (which come to think of it i didn't really use but its a GSHOCK so i just expected more). Don't really the band.\n",
            "These were too good to be true and I don't mean this in a good way. Wore it twice and the second time the watch broke right off. It's as cheaply made as it's cheap price! I DO NOT recommend these at all!\n",

They even started practicing waking up early for school 2 weeks before the school year! The alarm is loud enough, there is a light-up feature, and it's easy enough for my oldest to operate on his own.\n",
            "Beautiful watch! It's lightwieght and looks great on!\n",
            "Not properly sized...  They work but you could strip a wind point...  Use at your own risk if you know what you are doing!\n",
            "The color of the band is a really light brown.  I didn't think it went with the face at all.  Disappointed.\n",
            "This is so far below expectations it is mind boggling.<br /><br />Doesnt keep my Bulova or Seiko wound and it was a huge waste of money.<br /><br />Support is non existant and none responsive to requests for assistance.\n",
            "Very sleek and feminine, like another reviewer mentioned.  Very classy looking for a sports watch. So far, I am loving it.\n",
            "I've owned a lot of running watches, and have always had to choose between a band which fits my wrist band an easy-to-see display until I tried Armitron.  This watch is waterproof and nice enough looking that I haven't been taking it off, even for work.\n",

            "just love this watch. only bothered that it doesn't display the month (only the date). this is something i could have discovered before purchasing by looking more closely at the product description though.<br />i also didn't realize the strap is a three-piece velcro strap (easily seen in the video on the product page). i waver between liking this and wishing it was just a two piece velcro closure.<br /><br />love the colors though. wear this as often as i can.\n",
            "It's nice and comfortable.\n",
            "Excellent value.\n",
            "Bought this to wear while jet sking. I have an electronic dash clock, but its easier to just glance at my wrist. Easy to set the time and date. Lightweight: I don't even know its on my wrist.<br /><br />Con: After I set the band length for my wrist, it slightly stretched and the band slides down my wrist. I've tightened it again, still slides down, but its still snug enough that it won't slide past my wrist, I just wanted it to stay above my wrist bone. Guess its just to be expected. Not really a deal breaker. Also, I thought the watch face would be smaller, more feminine. Its a little larger than I expected for my petite wrist,  but since its not an &#34;everyday&#34; watch, it does the trick.\n",
            "Works well, looks good...\n",

It has come in handy on several occasions so it is well worth the cost. Glad I bought it.\n",
            "Amazing rose gold color. Very appealing to the eyes. Amazing movement.  Dead accurate & way better than MOST Swiss movements.  This is so close to Quartz accuracy.<br />I'm so impressed.\n",

            "Watch fell apart after 2 weeks. Only wore 4 times. Seller would not resolve issue. Through the watch away.\n",
            "I did not purchase this watch for the need of keeping track of time, more so to have a black band around my wrist.  It fits the need as well as has the time if I ever need it!  Also, works for a decent price.\n",
            "I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it, everything he needs in a watch!\n",
            "Love love love this watch.  I have a very small wrist so I had to take out a few links and it isn't quite fitted on my wrist but that is why I like it - not everyone might.  It looks like a mans watch but is still feminine.  I always get compliments when I wear it.\n",
            "The Armitron Men's 20/5048NVSVBN Day/Date Function Brown Croco-Grain Leather Strap Watch will not cause you to stand out in the crowd. Nor will it give you fancy extras like world time, multiple time zones, temperature, barometer, compass, etc. What it will give you is a smart looking watch with a nice Japanese movement and water resistance to 100 feet. You get all of this at a reasonable price.<br /><br />The watch face is easy to read with clear, large letters. The background is blue, but appears to be black when you hold the watch in certain ways depending on the light.<br /><br />This is a watch that can be worn any time to just about any place. It is formal enough to wear to nice occasions and inexpensive enough to wear everyday. All-in-all a decent watch at a reasonable price.\n",

My unit did not come with instructions, but it didn't take long to figure out. Mine *does* in fact display military (24 hour) time, or standard 12 hour time. This is toggled using the lower right button (after pressing the top one first) to cycle through Hour, Minute, Month, Day, Year, and then 12/24 time format. Note that the watch and band are not vertically symmetrical. The left side is curved, while the right side is straight. This may not be apparent from the pictures. I like it though, it adds some extra pizazz!\n",

With one, I fell into the water kayaking and almost immediately condensation began to form under the glass and stayed there until eventually it just went completely black.  As for the other, condensation again formed under the glass (FROM SWEAT WHILE WORKING OUT) except this time just half the watch went dead...the upper portion is black and the lower is working.<br /><br />Needless to say &#34;fool me twice, shame on me&#34;<br /><br />Don't get dooped, this watch is a POS\n",

I have to say for a picky person  like myself, I love it. I do not regret buying this item.  SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!\n",
            "I’m very impressed with this watch. I got the top model Invicta 9937 with Swiss movement in order to test if I can tolerate an automatic movement’s lack of precision compared with a top level quarts (I have a Tag Heuer Aquaracer Caliber-S). I have had it for a month now and besides its great looks, quality feel and impressive features for a watch this price (~450USD including import tax) it is extremely precise winning less than 1 sec a day. I have used it like you would with a sport watch cycling, swimming, normal work with the garden and everyday use and it just works as a charm. My original thought was if I like the mechanical movement I would replace it with a high end Tag Heuer, Omega or Breitling within a year or two, but I actually think I will stick with the Invicta now, providing it holds in the long run.\n",
            "This watch is a wonderful example of a mechanical timepiece. I love it. I may buy more soon.\n",
            "I got this watch in both the Matte Pink and Rubberized Gray because I wasn't sure which color I would like best. I was looking for something neutral that would match most of my wardrobe and I settled on the pink. The gray was certianly neutral, but the color closely resembled cadavers (TMI flashback to anatomy lab) and that disturbed me. I thought the size of the watch face might look a little silly on me, but I really like it and am excited that I could potential use it into old age (Hello, presbyopia!).<br /><br />I needed to remove two links from the watch and was easily able to do it myself. I've removed links from watches before and this had to be the simplest one I've ever done. Awhile ago I &#34;invested&#34; ($5 on eBay...) in a watch repair kit. Mine is similar to [[ASIN:B000T9VK56 GGI International Watch Repair Tool Kit]] which still has way more tools than you need for this particular watch. In my picture are all the tools I used. Watch a youtube video and DIY! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT5tO_UTDYU&spfreload=10<br /><br />I haven't worn it out and about enough to notice a dirtying effect that other reviewers have mentioned, but I'll set an alert in my calendar to write an update after I've had a chance to expose it to more of the 'elements'. UPDATE: I've worn this watch off and on for the last four months. It is showing no signs of discoloration and there are really no dirty spots to speak of!\n",
            "I purchased this watch for my husband to wear to work because I thought it would be durable and last for a while.  What a mistake.  He didn't get a chance to wear it out of the house, let a lone to work before it stopped working.  I just had to remind myself; you get what you pay for.\n",
            "Pleased!\n",
            "My original watch band was worn out from use,  I had a sport one.  The band does come with two of the spring studs so I didn't need to save off my old ones.  I kept them anyway just in case I did happen to lose one.  No issues with quality, or wear.  I think it feels better than the old one did .. but it's probably because it's new.\n",

            "This is a lovely watch, but it's heavy! Maybe I'm just used to lightweight &#34;rubber&#34; watches, but this has a definite heft to it.<br /><br />Also, I checked to make sure I'd ordered a *women's* watch because, holy cow, the bracelet is HUGE! I am not a tiny woman, and this watch needs probably three links removed. On a smaller gal, she probably couldn't lift her arm.<br /><br />This is called a &#34;boyfriend&#34; watch, so maybe it's supposed to look oversized. That, or some women have dinosaur bones.<br /><br />Overall,  I like it--I wanted a professional looking watch, not a fashion/costume jewelry piece. It's great-looking.<br /><br />The magnification over the date is awesome, and the face is easy to read. The night-glow is handy; all the points of the dial show, not just the hands/12/6.<br /><br />I'll wear it a while before I decide whether to have links removed,  or keep it in its &#34;boyfriend&#34; sizing.\n",

            "The watch arrived with a dead battery. Cost me 20$ extra to get that replaced. It doesn't seem to be doing a great job at keeping time considering it's 5 minutes behind after less than a month of usage. I'm giving it 3 stars because I like the way it looks  so it's got that going for it.\n",

            "I have been wearing my LeexGroup Smart Watch for several weeks now.  There are some features in it that I really like and others that I still haven't figured out.  There were no instructions with the packaging so I was pretty much on my own in setting it up.  Thankfully I have a friend who has other Smart Watches and she helped me.  The battery lasts about 3 days for me, but I am not surprised because I tend to run batteries down quickly.  I has a silicone band which I liked at the beginning, but have noticed that I am getting blisters from wearing in and sweating so I have placed bandaids under it.  Two features that I use all the time are the pedometer and the sleep monitor.  I am giving this a 3 out of 5 rating because I like it but I think I could like it much more if I knew how to operate it better.\n",
            "Love the watch, but too bulky for my taste!\n",
            "Nice watch. I love the style.\n",
            "As a dad of two girls, pink is BIG in my home. My eldest daughter is also HUGE into sports and has been wanting a sports watch like this for some time. This was the perfect size for her 11 year old wrist and still gave her room to grow into it as well. The watch has some great features including alarm, stopwatch, 12/24 hour option, light up face, water resistant, and the display was very easy to read. My daughter lovest playing with the stop watch to time herself in her running now too! The watch is well made and you can tell will stand up to a bit of a beating if it came to it, which is great for kids!<br /><br />* I received this product for review - all opinions are my own*\n",
            "Very nice design, silent running?\n",
            "Among the most disappointing product I bought watches\n",
            "Well made product exactly what I was looking for.\n",
            "Piece of crap\n",
            "Looks cheap\n",
            "This watch is awesome I want victorinox  from long time ago it is is perfect machine\n",
            "In excelent condition. delivered as expected\n",
            "Love it. The watch is a bit lighter colored in person, but is still beautiful.\n",
            "Minimalist and good watch\n",
            "The luxury goods\n",
            "This watch arrived and looked awesome! The flashing light worked but no time would display. Tried to fix it and had no luck. Super disappointed I wasted my money on this!\n",
            "People don't believe that I bought this for less than ten bucks! I love it, and while I'd prefer a fabric or breathable wristband, the watch still looks great today. I've never lost one of the rhinestones, so that's a huge plus, and it keeps time really well. If you don't mind the plastic band keeping your wrist sweaty and warm, which is my only con, then this is definitely a great &#34;dressy&#34; watch for you. It's bigger than a &#34;ladies&#34; watch that's only half an inch in diameter, but it has that little dressy addition to it that really helps it stand out!\n",
            "Very pretty, but very large. At first I thought it was a mans watch because the face was so big. I probably wouldn't order this again. It does work well and I received it quickly.\n",
            "This is a very cool looking retro watch, with a little &#34;steampunk&#34; vibe.  It's a windup watch. No battery to change, you dont have to keep in moving to wind etc. But you do have to remember to wind it.<br /><br />I received many compliments on how cool this watch looked. In fact, it gather more attention than my everyday Invicta.<br /><br />For my &#34;senior&#34; eyes, I'd prefer slightly larger and more luminous hands. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.<br /><br />As &#34;wrist jewelry&#34; it is a great idea, it gets attention and looks expensive.\n",
            "a nice clean watch.  The sizing is good, big and clean looking.\n",
            "Nice watch for the price, love the indiglo back light.\n",

            "Five Star.  Good quality\n",
            "Item arrived on time. I´m very happy!\n",
            "After wearing it for the second time, the band broke. I had to glue it back together with crazy glue.\n",
            "It was slightly a small face but I'm getting used to it fast. Its a beautiful watch.\n",
            "It said boys watch in the description.....very misleading.  This is an adult watch.\n",
            "A good looking watch but is heavy on the wrist.  The crown operation seemed sloppy and I could not set the day hand on the chronograph.  Chronograph windows are very small to view without bringing the watch close to your face.\n",
            "Received as promised\n",
            "It's cool stylish watch and great for the price\n",
            "As advertized, fast ship, great price.\n",
            "I like the fact that there are a variety of timer functions on the watch. It's waterproof too so I can take it for swimming or water sports. Plus it has a pretty decent backlight too so the time is visible even during the dark.\n",
            "Hubby needed strong watch to wear to work without leather strap.  This is it.  It is performing like an expensive watch.\n",
            "It's an awesome gift for my mom\n",
            "Lume is really bright, bezel clicks smooth and aligns perfectly. Showered with it daily and no problems with moisture. Screw in crown is smooth and accuracy is good. Overall great watch for the price.\n",
            "I bought this for my 13 year old son, he loves it.\n",
            "Gave this as a birthday gift, it went over VERY well!\n",
            "As an amateur watch repairwoman, I would have appreciated some instructions as to how to use some of the tools. I'm sure that one of these is probably designed to open waterproof/scuba type watches, but I can't figure out how to use it. I don't know what the other strange instrument is for. I found the pry tool handy in opening the back of most normal watches, but the edge has already gotten chipped, so it must be soft metal. The other pry tool doesn't seem helpful at all. I purchased a large quantity of broken watches, most of them needing a battery. So, I hoped that this kit would help me with that task. I've been able to open quite a few, but there are still some that I have been unable to open the back of.\n",
            "Very good and fine\n",
            "Delivered in just a few days. Beautiful watch!\n",
            "Good looking watch, My husband got it and he loves it\n",
            "Well please with my purchase.\n",
            "Beware, this clock is only 16 inches in diameter not 18 inches in diameter. One star is for the erroneous description, not the clock itself. Returned.\n",
            "I bought this watch on a whim a few years ago and have kept it in rotation because it can be an everyday, workout and dress watch. The alarm function hasn't worked since I changed the battery (any suggestions are welcome), but that's a small thing. Bottom line, it's a great watch and the timer, stopwatch and dual time/DST functions are just what I need when traveling.\n",
            "Too short for a woman's watch. Now I have to get an extension\n",
            "I ordered this watch.  I am disappointed because the time-marked bezel does not rotate.  It is fixed in position so it is mainly ornamental.  You cannot use it to to keep track of elapsed time.\n",
            "Great looking, sturdy watch.\n",
            "Nice whatch...\n",
            "Crown came out after 1 week of wear. Looks way cheaper in person than it does in the photos. Save your time and money and go for a more reliable brand.\n",
            "great watch for everyday use.. cant beat a casio\n",
            "Nice watch .....hard to put on\n",
            "I saw this watch on the Amazon home page and had to have it.  It is a classy looking watch.  I am very happy with my purchase\n",
            "Nice\n",
            "I purchased this as a gift.  I wasn't sure how the yellow face was going to look but I<br />Must say that it does catch your eye when my friend wears it. You don't see this color face on a watch often, and his favorite color is yellow, so he was very pleased with the watch. You just aren't expecting that flash of color, especially since most men's watches have a dark face. I think it looks nice and a little sporty. Plus Fossil makes great watches at great prices!\n",
            "Great\n",
            "Awesome. Getting a lot of compliments.\n",
            "This was a birthday gift for my daughter. I thought it looked okay but she loved it. I didn't realize the middle links of the band are PLASTIC. I thought it made it look cheap. It comes in a very big size so it should fit just about any wrist. My daughter is on the small side so she had to have 4 links removed.\n",
            "I love watches.  I recently bought an expensive watch from a different brand and the band nearly broke when I put it on.  This watch is sturdy, the color can go with just about anything and I love the fact that it has the see through portions.\n",
            "This watch has to be one of the greatest watches I have ever owned! It has a perfect fit and a great look. It looks great on all outfits and is great for everyday use! This watch won't let you down.\n",
            "The new band fell apart in one week. I was not impressed.\n",
            "Great product, I love it\n",
            "Is it a Rolex?? No its just a piece of knock-off junk. Another attempt to look like the real thing. Be a man and get the real thing. This is so sad.\n",
            "Great watch!\n",
            "Nice watch.\n",
            "I've had 4 links removed because of my small wrist but this watch is just as beautiful as I imagined it to be. I'm already receiving so many compliments.\n",
            "Love this watch. Real quality and great value.\n",
            "Great watch!\n",
            "Very nice watch\n",
            "Love this watch! My battery stopped after only a few months, however. :(\n",
            "This is the second one of these watches that I have bought.  On the first one, the strap broke after a year.  I hope this one hold up better.  Watch works well and is easy to use.\n",
            "Sent back, runs very large, even taking out links would not fit...\n",
            "great.super!\n",
            "Replacement for an identical older model, need to have the band shortened, which is not an easy task. Good watch overall. Update: Now the replacement watch has failed also and refuses to change to the correct time zone, so have to mentally subtract 3 hours from the displayed time. It's not a bad watch in design and function when working...just doesn't last long enough to make it worth while to keep replacing it every couple of years. Moving on to something more reliable, burned out on Casio!\n",
            "It's a nice looking watch but I had to return it because the bracelet itself was too small for my dad's wrist.\n",
            "I am very disappointed in this Timex piece.  it loses time about 3-5 hours per day.  What a waste of my time. Now I have to go return it and get a refund.  I like the overall design...just a bad product.  Its a shame that Timex did not demand better quality control when sourcing this out for manufacture.  Also, the second hand does not line up to 12 noon!....pet peeve of mine.  Do not buy this product is my recommendation.\n",
            "Outstanding watch...exactly what I was looking for.\n",
            "When I bought this watch I didn't expect much, it was cheap so I just assumed it would be cheaply made.  It arrived long before Amazon estimated and in fantastic condition!  The watch both feels and looks nice, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.\n",
            "Love the way it looks. The date mechanism broke however in the first week.\n",
            "Great watch\n",
            "This is a very nice piece for the price you pay. At first I was a bit concerned that my buddies would think I bought it to pass it off as a Submariner and although they are similar its a watch to be proud of on its own. I am a project manager by trade for an industrial process contractor which takes me to some pretty unique jobsites at times. I bought this to retire my Tag as my daily wearer just due to the environments I will expose it to each day. I could not be happier with the purchase and hope you give this one a shot.\n",
            "I agree with a previous comment regarding the size of the band.  If I had seen that first I might not have purchased the watch.  I am also a woman and have the band on the last hole.  I purposely bought this one because it said it is a Unisex band.  That is misleading.  I have not had the watch very long, so can not report much about it except that it is a nice looking watch.\n",
            "I love, love, love my watch. It's adorable and comfortable. Basically my new best friend. I was surprised about the light up in the dark feature when I first got it, which only made it that more awesome. I've worn it in the shower about 4 times now, only for 5-10 minutes and it's still running perfectly.\n",
            "I had to return it. The button to set the time and perform other functions was too sensitive and I could never get it it set up properly, never mind use it.\n",
            "My wrist was always empty. However, the clock went to the vacancy. Dandy as the best product.\n",
            "This chronograph watch is very handsome and affordable too!\n",
            "Excellent\n",
            "Didn't live up to the description once I saw it in person.\n",
            "Great Watch, Good Features but the Dial is quite small compared to the pictures and the LED's are very dim.\n",
            "Great face. I love the simple classic style but the band is itchy.\n",
            "My third and maybe favorite bulova. Glamorous blue tint on the face really shines. Will get you lots of compliments.\n",
            "I love the vostok mechanicals. I now have 3. They are a fun watch.\n",
            "This watch is a winner - can be dressy or casual.  Watch face is perfect - not too large, not too small.  The leather watch bands are easy to change and are thick enough to last and thin enough to wrap around a wrist comfortably.  I have a small wrist and have to use the last hole but it works fine.\n",
            "Band was broken out of box!!!\n",
            "Exactly what I needed.\n",
            "love it\n",
            "Love this clock. I have the white version as well.\n",
            "I love it\n",
            "very good\n",
            "For the money, this is a great wristwatch for outdoors. It has a canvas strap and Velcro for securing onto the wrist, one great feature is the strap itself. I have a large wrist which makes it difficult to find a watch band to fit but with the Forester no problem. For darkness it has a large button on the same side as the date window to illuminate the entire face for about 5 seconds then it goes off but with plenty of time to see the clock face. The downsides are the plastic housing (metal back) and the plastic lens, but for the price (15.00) with Prime - what the heck. Overall I am pleased with this watch and it does all that I would expect for a cheap, outside work watch. The biggest reason I gave 4 stars was the plastic lens.\n",
            "For years now my husband has been complaining that he doesn't have a good watch. To him, a &#34;good watch&#34; is one that is professional but still interesting to look at and conveys his sense of style. That doesn't seem like it would be hard to find, but I've been searching for years! This watch is perfect! It has a very clear face, a sophisticated band, and beautiful subdials. I thought that this was the PERFECT watch. However, when it showed up the face of the watch was A LOT bigger than I thought. I looked at the pictures provided but couldn't get a clear picture of how large the watch is. It wasn't until later that I noticed the dimensions in the description. I was very disappointed when I saw how large it was because it was actually too big for my husband. The wrist band fit and is adjustable, but the face is large to the point that it looks a bit goofy on his arm. Fortunately, I am going to give it to my dad who has make larger hands so it won't look as out of place. Still, it's a beautiful watch no matter what!\n",
            "Casio G-Shock\n",
            "This is the best watch I have ever bought if you look on the v channel you will see this at over £600 it's marvellous what this watch can do have bought 10 different ladies and gents watches of same brand\n",
            "Did not work\n",
            "The time was easy to set but had trouble with setting date.\n",
            "Great chronograph watch with an over sized dial and leather band of very good quality.<br />Also really like the minutes numbers on the dial and the small second dial.<br />Recommend to anyone who wants an all purpose watch to use for formal, work or sports. Especially the chronograph for keeping time when running and time between sets when lifting.\n",
            "Use this everyday. Love it keeps watch clean and wound\n",
            "ok\n",
            "so far so good except you need 20/20 plus vision to read the tiny date window.\n",
            "I love it so much.its exactly what I saw and requested for.thanks.\n",

            "Love it. Easy to set up. Simply read directions. I have small arms and wrist and looks great on me. Light weight. Great price, fast shipping and good quality. High Five!!!!\n",
            "Comfortable and breathable. I love the color and the fact that it is waterproof. The band is slimmer than Women's IronMan watches that I have had in the past and it is very becoming.\n",

            "Way to big for my wrist, and don't like the watch enough to bother taking it to a jeweler to adjust it.  To me the watch seemed &#34;cheap&#34;\n",
            "This watch is very cute; every time I where the watch people compliment the watch.  Its kind of rose color and very vibrant and expensive &#34;looking&#34;.  This is a great knock off for the MK watch\n",

            "First - you have to be a large person as the watch diameter is 5.2 but also very high off your wrist.<br />It is a beautiful watch .<br />Note- to change the time -<br />Pull out the crown , turn it halfway and hold .<br />The watch does the rest.\n",
            "I really like this watch. My only complaint is that the date window is so small you can't tell what the date is at a glance, you have to really hold the watch up close to your face and even then you almost need a magnifying glass. Still, a gorgeous watch, and very handy to have the two time zones.\n",

            "I love my watch. Water proof too. Had it for a little over a year. Still ticking. Got it from the Swatch store on Perimeter Mall.\n",
            "Great watch for the price. Love it.\n",
            "This is my review of the Swatch Sistem51 model SUTS402, Sistem Class, 2015.  The Sistem51 watch was released by Swatch in 2013 when they introduced the watch in four colorways.  The Sistem Class, which I picked up at a Swatch Store, is currently one of a dozen Sistem51 designs to choose from.<br /><br />Two models ship with leather straps and the remainder are outfitted with silicone straps.  The black silicone strap on the Sistem Class is accented with a blues buckle, keeper and stitching matching the blue case.  Case material, to include crystal and clear caseback, is plastic.  Fortunately I've not have the opportunity to scuff the crystal yet.  My experience with Swatch is the plastic crystals will scuff, however can be buffed out fairly easily.  The size of the case is 42 mm.  I find the light weight of this watch coupled with the soft-feel silicone strap provides a comfortable wear.<br /><br />Sistem51 watches are Swiss made, 19 jewel, mechanical, self-winding watches.  The 51 parts are assembled in a cleanroom by robotics and the watch case is then hermetically sealed.  The watch case cannot be opened and the watch cannot be serviced.  When I purchased my watch the paperwork was date stamped by Swatch which activated a 2-year manufactures warranty.  The water resistant rating is 3 bar or 30 meters, which equates to splash or rain resistance and not bathing or swimming from what I've read on watch WR ratings.  In addition to the time the watch displays the day of the month.  The Sistem Class’ black face with white characters is easy to read.  The lumes are limited to the minute and hour hands, lacking any dark environment illumination for the hour markers.  The white dots on the black bezel at the hour markers contributes to the look of the watch.<br /><br />The watch has a sweeping second hand as it’s a mechanical watch, unlike the the second hand tick of a quartz movement watch.  The second hand does not hack, meaning it won’t stop when the crown is pulled out to set the watch.  When going back in time during a setting, the second hand will stop and sometimes roll backward a couple of seconds before it begins to advance again.  The specks for this watch state a 90-hour power reserve.  I tend to only wear this watch on the weekends requiring winding and setting prior to wear.  I don't mind this, however if your not routinely wearing the watch you won't be able to grab and go each time you wear it.<br /><br />The Sistem51 collection really gets interesting when you view the movement through the clear caseback.  A majority of the visible parts are outfitted with graphic designs, which gives a nice visual when the rotor turns as the watch is moved.  This action is what winds the watch during wear.  The watch can also be wound manually when needed by turning the crown counterclockwise.  During wear in a quite environment you can hear the moving parts doing what they do.  I’ve found during daily wear I do not notice the sound of the rotor, only when it’s quite and I’m paying attention to it.<br /><br />Depending on your perception the price point may seem high for a plastic watch or low for an automatic.  I find the Sistem Class to be a cool looking, casual / sporty watch with an interesting story.  The black and blue design along with the watch face looks great in my opinion.  I don’t believe it goes out of its way to be an attention grabber unless you leave it face down on a table.<br /><br />I give the watch an overall rating of 5 stars.\n",
            "I liked this, but I ended up returning it. I wanted more of a boyfriend watch that was also matte. This is a very shiny silver watch with a smaller face. I ended up not liking how it looked on my wrist. I wanted something with a bigger face. I probably would have kept it if it were not so shiny.\n",
            "This OK!\n",
            "Excellent product and seller! Would highly recommend!\n",
            "Fits our G shock.  My son changed his band all by himself.  Works very well.\n",
            "It's a nifty device. Unfortunately it's not compatible with iOS as it requires a Bluetooth app to install to your phone so you can access text messages and email. The Bluetooth works just for calls but certain numbers I select to make a call it pops up with a message saying unavailable. At times it doesn't want to scroll through my contacts easily usually bouncing back to the first name. When selecting the city I live it doesn't offer any cities in Texas for time zone so I had to choose Chicago. But for the price it isn't too bad bout as much use I'd find of an Apple watch. I rate it so low because of the compatibility to my iPhone.\n",
            "This watch has style and functionality size and weight for a larger man GREAT buy at double the price.\n",
            "Cute watch... good price!\n",

            "Great value !!  Highly recommend it.\n",
            "The watch isn't as durable as I thought. Barely dropped it once and the case came off.\n",
            "Worn it twice abd received several compliments it was a really good buy\n",
            "Adequate, bought it when my other watch got lost. Found other watch when this was delivered. Use it sometimes anyhow. I wish the numbers were also luminous, and not just the hands... but that's a minor issue.\n",
            "Great for the price\n",
            "I love this strap. Initially I thought it would hurt my wrist. This strap is though and rigid but it adapts to my measurement just fine. I totally recommend it, guys!\n",

            "this watch has a nice imitation businessman look, but has a serious problem.  Any time that it gets hit, or even bumped a little, it stops,  and if it gets bumped again (or if I intentionally ht it) it starts again.  So the watch may be running, but be three hours late.  Not a big problem when I am at the desk, but when I am active, or working with things, it stops a lot!\n",
            "I received this watch as a gift. I liked it very much. It is very attractive and the functions all worked well. I had worn this watch while swimming in a chlorinated pool and it still worked fine. Cleaning the watch is easy because of the material it is made of. The reason this watch is receiving 3 stars is because I wore this watch to the beach the other day and some water got into the watch. The backside of the watch states that it water resistant up to 100 meters. I did not even go past 3 meters in the water, and also for not an extended period of time.<br /><br />I assume that this watch is not salt-water resistant. I would have repurchased, but I will instead look for a sturdier watch that is more water proof. It is a nice watch, and I am sad that it no longer works.\n",

Kid-style hand washing) we have had this go dead a day later.<br /><br />We have been through 3 of them..but if they can remind her to go, it's money well spent\n",

            "Love this watch so many compliments ! Nice watch and fictional.<br /><br />Pros , looks , build & design.<br /><br />Cons , gun metal shows oil smudges & watch band seems to light. Probably to help reduce weight of the watch\n",

            "Nice watch.\n",
            "Great little watch for the price.  Durable, comfortable to wear and reasonably easy to adjust.  I use it primarily as a travel and vacation watch so I can leave my better watches at home.  It is very useful to have the dual time function, especially when traveling abroad.  This is the second iteration of this watch that I have owned and recommended it highly.\n",
            "I got lots of compliments on the look of this watch, but the battery stopped after six months. For the price, I figured I would just buy another one, but when that one arrived it wasn't working at all. Get what you pay for, I suppose.\n",

            "Love it. A little hard to see in low light, to be expected.<br />Everyone notices it and make great comments regarding its look.\n",
            "It's not high quality, so I wasn't expecting much. I wasn't disappointed. The &#34;fabric&#34; wristband is plasticized and hard, and the rough edges can hurt. The grommets that kept the holes open for putting the watch on fell off after just a few uses. However, it's a very usable watch, still runs great, keeps the time month after month, and I like it. If I knew anything about watches, I might try to change out the wristband, but until then, I will wear this watch until it dies on me!\n",
            "I've had this watch for a while now with no problems and I break my G-Force bands every few months,  nothing but complements since I've had this watch, everyone thinks it's some expensive brand watch and it's nothing but chrome plastic inside lol..\n",

This watch is a high octane, testosterone boosting, pantie dropping, High out put, compressed piece of pure manliness. The only thing comperible is the next greatest thing...that is YOU... YES YOU!!! This watch was meant for a man like you! And if you ain't a man yet be prepared to become one upon arrival of this here time piece because when you put this bad mofo on. You will slip your boots on grab your axe and go out back and split wood for the furnace that you don't even have! And come back In and shovel down some meat and potatoes through that 2inch hole you call a throat! This watch is a great buy! I love the look the feel and the features! Stop procrastinating and cowboy up send the bartered gold and buy you one of these bad boys you won't regret it!!!\n",

            "Swiss Legend Men's 10013-RG-11-BB World Timer Collection Chronograph Stainless Steel Watch<br /><br />Overview<br />This is an exquisite timepiece (watch) which you will proudly wear.  The price is absolutely phenomenal as the quality is impeccable.  The watch comes in a very nice case with a very practical instruction manual.  This is needed to truly understand the chronograph functions.<br /><br />The watch has the look and feel of more popular and more expensive watches.  It is a bit heavy, but that is what you expect from a high quality chronograph.<br /><br />The description indicates “rose” but unless I am color-blind, it is more like a light bronze.  The watch comes assembled for a large wrist.  Even though I am 6’3” I like a more snug fit, so I had to deal with removing a link or two.  The instructions say to clearly get an authorized dealer to complete the adjustment, however I am familiar with these types of watches and figured it was worth a gamble to Do It Myself.  I visited YouTube just to make sure I was comfortable in tinkering with this jewel.  I was able to complete the adjustment in less than 5 minutes – basically it’s pretty simple as long as you take your time.  One thing you will love is the final look is more of a fine piece of jewelry.  This is noticeable on the band as there is not a clamp which is typical on these types of watches.  The clamp (clasp) fold in both directions so you have a seamless bracelet and the look is very nice.<br /><br />Pros<br />• Outstanding craftsmanship<br />• Direction booklet is pretty straightforward<br />• Chronograph is easy to read.<br />• Has a very durable look.<br />• The clasp opens by pressing each side and as simple as this may appear, you will find it very practical.<br />• Comes with a 5 year Warranty.<br />• Looks outstanding on your wrist.<br /><br />Cons<br />Can be tricky if you are not use to Chronographs or these types of watches.  The adjustment is simple but many may need to consult a jeweler versus damaging the product.<br /><br />Summary<br />A great technological Chronograph which provides the type of quality you expect, at a fraction of the cost.  A very practical timepiece which is versatile to wear in a variety of settings; from dress to casual.<br /><br />P.S.  Since most may wish to have watch resized, I will be posting a simple video to help you out.  In the meantime YouTube has some great videos, not for this watch specifically, but the engineering is pretty much the same across manufacturers.[[ASIN:B003XOQFHM Swiss Legend Men's 10013-RG-11-BB World Timer Collection Chronograph Stainless Steel Watch]]need to consult a jeweler versus damaging the product.<br /><br />Summary<br />A great technological Chronograph which provides the type of quality you expect, at a fraction of the cost.

            "It looks great, feels great on the hand, and has held up to a great deal of punishment. I have taken it into the surf many times and it keeps on ticking.\n",
            "Great watch! Love the black backlight. I've had this for almost a year now and I couldn't be happier.\n",
            "Great watch!! - Got the best price using Amazon.\n",
            "Thanks Nice one\n",
            "This is a pretty watch. The second hand is the same color as the strap. If the strap gets dirty, just take it off the face and wash it. I gave this to my 11 year old granddaughter.\n",
            "This was a gift for my mother for her birthday.  She loved it.\n",
            "Stopped keeping time after 2 weeks. Would always have to shake it every couple mins to keep it going even after winding it up\n",
            "Item received was not genuine. Many discrepancies that shouldn't be.\n",
            "Very nice band. Fit my pebble watch.\n",
            "The watch is magnificent, it has a smooth sweeping hand, the chronograph is very precise and the design is astonishing. It's a must have for all watch enthusiasts.\n",
            "Great watch. Love the silicone strap.\n",
            "I wanted an alarm wristwatch I could set for appointments and because I can't hear high frequencies I bought a vibrating one. To my dismay it had an instruction sheet that unfolded to about 10 square feet with microscopic printing in 4 or 5 different languages. It also had five buttons that enabled you to program an immense array of complicated functions such as having it signal with different patterns for different applications although I could not really understand it.  However i was not able to figure out how to make it vibrate at a future time so it is worthless for the purpose I purchased it for.\n",
            "Just like my other watches. Lots of compliment for this watch.\n",
            "My brother bought me this watch as a graduation present. About a year later, I lost it while on vacation. I decided to try out another watch, but realized I liked this one much better, so I returned the other and bought this one again.<br /><br />Pros: This watch is very inexpensive for a quality watch. It is very lightweight to the point that I barely feel it on my wrist, and also quite durable. This makes it perfect for everyday use. It may not be the most luxurious looking watch but I think it has a nice modest yet bold look to it. It should be noted that the watch appears more jet black in person than this picture (which depicts the face as slightly brown). It is very easy to read and includes a slot to show the date, and will glow when you press in the crown, making it great for dark timekeeping as well.<br /><br />Cons: It can be a little tricky to change the date. The crown has to be halfway extended and it is easy to either push it in or pull it out all the way instead of stopping in between.<br /><br />Overall: This watch will only set you back a little over $20, but looks and feels like a much more expensive one. It will last you a long time, unless you lose yours like me.\n",
            "Really nice, looks exactly like the product but not as sturdy as I would've liked. Still glad I bought it. My friend loved it.\n",
            "This watch is very beautiful! I love how elegant it looks specially because of the diamonds inside the watch..\n",
            "Very nice case. These 8-slot cases are both very good for watch storage and a collector item in their own right. I have several and this blue/yellow is very striking.\n",
            "After less than one year the watch began to stop.  It wasn't the battery since I would get it running again. It kept good time when running. When I checked with Amazon  I discovered that the watch was covered by Wenger's 3 year guarantee and I would need to deal with them.  When I checked out Wenger's warranty repair procedures I discovered that I would have to pay for shipping and insurance both ways.  I decided it wasn't worth the cost.\n",
            "I'm on sail boats, working in the yard, hiking, etc and am rough on watches.  I have bought this model for the past 10 years and it's perfect for my lifestyle.  It has the features I need (water resistent, stop watch, alarm, light for face when needed) at a price that makes me comfortable wearing it in rough conditions.\n",

            "very nice\n",
            "This is a nice budget watch. The face looks good but it's very small. Maybe a little too small for most people. Everything is made of plastic but the watch doesn't look too cheap. Definitely does not look expensive either. Very minimalist, which is what I prefer.  Works with a wide range out of outfits. Doesn't make a loud ticking noise. If it runs out of battery I think it would be easier to just buy another watch at this price point.  If it wasn't for the tiny watch face size I'd give this watch 5 stars.\n",
            "I ordered I believe 3 sets.  I only got one set that is complete if I remember correctly.  I got three of the same color in one shipment.  What would I do with three of the same colors.  Although it was mentioned that you may get two of one color.  I am happy with the one with complete set but not the one with duplicate colors.  The good thing is these were very inexpensive watches because they were on sale.  I hope they last.\n",

            "VERY GOOD WATCH ,A QUALITY WATCH ENVICTA\n",
            "I'm biased - I'm a big Harley Davidson fan. This watch is absolutely gorgeous. Easy to read but (IMO) not gaudy and looks more expensive than it is. Blue is not a usual Harley color and it doesn't scream &#34;Harley groupie!&#34; to the world. Bulova is a solid, well known name and they make excellent lower to midrange price watches. Like I said - I'm a Harley guy but I highly recommend this watch.\n",

            "Nice looking<br />Very Sharp..\n",
            "Great little watch that is perfect for my needs. It's simply a working watch that has a backlight for nighttime.<br /><br />The only downside was that I thought the strap would be a military style Olive Drab color but is actually much lighter than that. Luckily I had a black strap that I put on and am currently very happy with my purchase.\n",

Great for an active lifestyle too.<br /><br />Highly recommended\n",
            "Replacement for a similar Timex that I had for several years and the band broke (easier to just get a whole new watch). Bit clunkier than the previous one - but keeps good time and is easy to read. I am not an athlete so I don't need all of the fancy stopwatch functions. But it does the job.\n",

The watches  are nice with  a beautiful design and  bling and I would like them if they were not so big and heavy. I like my watches light weight and smaller than these watches. Even the larger face  watches I have are thinner and not so much bulk. I will have to get directions for returning merchandise.<br /><br />Annette L Wisniewski\n",

I don't know why all these gorgeous watches are made for a man's wrist they should be made for a ladies as well. This watch is so beautiful I know most ladies would love it if it would come in a 40 mm size\n",

Also has alarm, stopwatch, dual time zones, and illuminated dial. I work a lot outdoors in the weather and muck, and the watch band tends to wear out after about a year or so. My practice has been to buy a new one before the old wears out, and will wear the new one for meetings and nicer wear, while I continue to use the older worn watch for working outdoors, which extends the life for my usage, and works with the reasonable cost for a new one. Hope this model is still around late 2016 into 2017 when this one may need to be replaced.\n",
            "Pretty watch, gold catches the light as you move, nice weight, comfortable thin band...in other words, cool design.  But is it practical?  The glass in this purple is mostly smoky black, barely rosy as pictured, and dark, extremely dark! You need direct sunlight, your eyeball two inches in front of the dial, and just the right angle to tilt it over and over to see through the nearly opaque glass underneath to the hands.  As a bracelet it rocks.  As a watch, this is a designer fail in this color combo.  Indoor use is pretty impossible, as would be evening wear.  But, it looks pretty!\n",
            "Cheap junk but if one needs a watch and wants it to &#34;kinda&#34; look like a Rolex Submariner then I suppose this is the watch for you. It's a sad thing when a watch company blatantly copies the style of another companies watch design. Legal or not, its just sad.\n",

I've had the watch for about two months and I fear after a few more months the entire thing will both look hideous and be illegable. Good value though, fits nicely, looks sharp.\n",

            "A bit confusing.\n",
            "I own several invictas but this is definitely one of my favorites\n",
            "This seems like a pretty nice watch for the price.  But the spring bars holding the strap to the case are very weak.  A few days after I purchased the watch, it fell off my wrist as I was putting on a jacket, and it hit the floor and the case was cosmetically damaged.  I decided to exchange it and try another one.  The next one flew off my wrist when I started my lawn mower, and it was damaged (one of the hands fell off).  I returned it for a refund.  I want a watch I can wear regularly without worrying about it falling off my wrist.<br /><br />Maybe you can buy stronger spring bars, but it could be that the holes in the case are not deep enough...not sure.\n",

            "Smaller than expected.\n",
            "Guys, it's supposed to be big and heavy. It's a 52mm watch. Don't blame the watch, blame yourself for not doing your research first. If you're not into big<br />bulky watches, anything over 46mm is going to be big. Stick with a 38-42mm case size watch and you won't be crying those crocodile tears...😣\n",
            "Arrived fully solar charged and time set to my city. Paid for it to ship overnight and it was delivered as expected. It looks great on a slim hand and it stands out compared to other regular g-shocks. Worth the $128 spent on it. Haven't had a problem with the solar charge during this past week since receiving it. Have used it outdoors but never consciously tried charging it by facing the sun. This is my third g-shock and my first one that costs more than $50. Love the look and the feel of wearing it. Also like the world clock on it. The backlight is bluish green. The other features like moon, temperature, compass works but have not used it actively.\n",

            "Looks good, uncluttered face is attractive and easy to read, and the leather band is soft and comfortable.  Got just what I wanted and expected!\n",
            "Exactly what I was looking for.  Accurate, reliable, and easy to read -- night or day.  It's light and comfortable.  The only way I could have been happier would have been for Luminox to bring back the discontinued yellow dial version of this watch.\n",
            "Very nice looking and functional time piece.  I get compliments on this watch on a regular basis.  The best part is that this time piece is an excellent value as well.  5 stars without a doubt.\n",
            "So far great! Have large wrists had to remove links. Looks great feels good! Lots of people remark. This is a large watch, just want I wanted. Great price.\n",
            "The first one I received had a faulty hinge that was bent. I returned the box. The replacement seems ok, and I must say is very quite, compared with the one I previously had.<br />Do not have high expectations because of the use of the word &#34;quality&#34;. This is box is hopefully value for money in the long run.<br />There are a few silly imperfections that could have been caught during manufacture.<br />Overall I am satisfied.\n",
            "Loved this even more in person.\n",

            "I love it. It was a gift from my boyfriend and it looks great. I always loved his gshock watches and wanted one of my own. I love the black and pink colors together. It's a girly version of a gshock watch. So cute\n",
            "Awesome watch! If you like Casio brand watches, you will not be disappointed!\n",
            "Love this watch. the band was a little big on my arm, because I have small arms. I took it to the watch shop and had two links removed. All my friends want to buy this watch now. It beautiful and it just glee on my arm.\n",

            "I bought a Timex® Men's EXPEDITION® Rugged Field SHOCK Analog Watch #T49261  for $36.98. I had a previous watch with the same model number for a decade and successfully used it snorkeling and diving to 100 ft on numerous occasions. The stem eventually corroded and fell off. I liked the leather wrist band although I had to replace it after a few years and the night light was quite helpful in reading the time at night. However, when I bought the new watch, I could not read the time as well either during the day or with the night light at night. Perhaps it is my advancing age, but I think the outline of the hands is not as bold as it used to be. When used with a white watch face, the luminous  white hands should be boldly outlined in black. For this reason, I subtract a star.\n",
            "Not real pleased with this purchase. The clock stops sometimes and it is hard to manage the different settings.\n",
            "I love this watch. I think I've had about 9 or so of them over the last 30 years. I keep buying them because they're so easy to use they have 3 alarms  and the Indiglo light works really well in illuminating the face at night. I will keep buying them when the next one wears out as long as they make them.\n",

            "The quality for the price make this watch a real value.\n",
            "A beautiful watch with a huge face that is very easy to read. The style is handsome and I would recommend it to anyone. It does not, however, have a date window which  always  comes in handy and would  have been a great feature.\n",
            "This is a huge and gorgeous watch. I wear it every day and get a lot of lookers and compliments. The band does lack quality, but has not broken as others have described although it is splitting it has not broken through. I do have callouses on my wrist and hand from wearing it. It took a bit to get used to, but it is part of me now.\n",

            "Amazon should advertise the size of the straps---regular, long, or x long.  The strap pictured looked long enough but wasn't.  I needed an long strap to fit my wrist.  After going over the different pages of watch straps available at Amazon, I took a change on the one purchased---not good.<br /><br />Saying that the strap is 18mm wide should have been tagged that it was regular also.  It was a wasted effort.<br /><br />Bottom line---I went elsewhere on the internet to buy the correct size band.  I am not saying that I will not buy other products from Amazon but this time around, I got burned.\n",
            "While the watch face is easy to read and just what I need, the band runs a bit small. It would have been given a 4 star rating had it fit better.\n",
            "I was very impressed at the quality and design of this watch.<br />It is a stylish and functional watch.\n",
            "Get lots of positive comments on this watch.  I have a fat wrist and this one was too big, but it was easy to have the jeweler adjust it to fit my wrist.\n",

            "I saw this watch in my queue and thought it would be a nice option for my left-handed husband. (The product description indicated that it was made with lefties in mind.) I was impressed by the quality and appearance of this watch. It looks very high-end and has an impressive heft to it without being overly heavy. It also has an oversized face which is nice for aging men or those with eye problems. The watch band is nice as well. My husband liked it a lot and is wearing it more than his usual, beloved Seiko. Over all, a nice watch at a decent price.\n",
            "Husband loved it!!!!!!!!\n",

            "This watch is awesome for the price.  Google the model number and you will see many watch freaks talking about this watch.  The lume is bright, just doesn't last forever.  The watch is fairly accurate, I have timed it but it is well within specs.  The jubilee bracelet is a little cheap feeling when off the wrist, but put it on the wrist and it transforms into a comfortable bracelet that looks great.  There are some great after market bracelets on amazon that I might &#34;upgrade&#34; to one day but its really not needed.\n",
            "After 6 months of use the finish is starting to really show its age, some links needed some wd40 at first and have been fine since.\n",

            "Great\n",
            "This is a great watch. My husband is totally blind so he depends on his watch. The only complaints he had was the band was a little tight. If it doesn't loosen up I can replace it. The other complaint he said was the voice. The voice says tirteen for 13 and tirty for 30. I guess if those are his only complaints, I give it 5 stars.\n",

            "Nice\n",
            "Great, functional watch. I work at a medical facility, so it looks a bit unprofessional when I'm constantly reaching into my pocket and looking at my phone to tell time. Especially when I'm inside a clinic. I wanted something that looks classy, was easy-to-read, and had a leather band. This watch fits all 3 criteria perfectly. I like that it wasn't too expensive, so if it gets scratched/damaged during everyday wear-and-tear, I won't be too sad about it. Only con is that it ticks very loudly. It's nothing I can't get used to though.\n",
            "as advertised\n",
            "Very nice watch\n",

Although I was told I would receive a full refund when I tried to return it, which I haven't gotten as of yet, I was told to keep the watch and change the battery.  I changed the battery and the watch still does not work.  Don't waste your time or money on this product.\n",

            "good\n",
            "This watch is very, VERY lightweight. The band isn't as sturdy as I was hoping given it is titanium but I guess if it was a thicker and heavier band, the cost of the watch would exponentially increase, hah. The face of the watch is very open and bright allowing the numbers to really pop which makes it easier to steal a quick glance at. This watch is great if you find yourself always readjusting your watch because it slid down too far onto your hand causing movement restriction as the light weight of the watch doesn't make the watch droop so far down so easily.<br /><br />The only con to this watch I'd say is with it being so light you almost forget you're wearing a watch!\n",
            "Cheap Item. The watch broke after I wore it 2 times.\n",
            "I needed a battery for my car remote.  Buying a new remote runs about $150, so this was a much better alternative.  I also needed to buy a tiny screwdriver to open the case, but it worked!  Remote works great now.\n",

            "One of my favorite g-shocks.\n",
            "Very nice looking watch and well worth the price paid have bought two other men's of same brand will buy others when I see different designs\n",

            "Great watch, great deal. Not a big fan of expensive stuff, but as a huge watch fan and space nerd I had to buy this. Well worth it. Very accurate watch and beautiful, simple design. If I could buy this watch 1000 times, I would!\n",

            "Love it!!\n",
            "Beautiful watch with all the features that you expect from an Citizen Eco Drive watch.<br />I just think the strap should have a better quality because besides the blue side is leather the yellow side is plastic or synthetic. (Seems to be fragile or will degrade easily)\n",
            "I can easily recommend this product. No, it isn't among the top-of-the-line winders, far from it in fact, but it's been getting the job done for me.  I recently purchased 2 Hamilton automatic watches, and alternate between them every week, so the one that I'm not wearing on that given week will always be ready to go when the time comes to put it on. The 4 rotate/idle settings that this offers is an excellent feature, and one can also select whether it will rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, or alternate. I've read that previous models had a blue light that couldn't be turned off, and I'm glad this one has the option to have it off. I really can't see why anyone would want it on other than purely for &#34;show.&#34;<br /><br />The motor is super-quiet, a huge plus if you keep it in your bedroom like I do. And I'm not sure if any other reviewer has touched upon this, but another very useful feature of this model is the cover, which keeps your watch dust-free. So all in all, a very nice winder that might not be the fanciest out there but gets the job done, for a lot less money than what others cost.\n",
            "My grandchild loved her birthday present!\n",

            "For the price nice watch for sure\n",
            "I absolutely love this watch. In fact, this is my second one. I also bought another one with black face and stainless steel band.<br />The front face of this watch is beautiful, it has two numbers, &#34;12&#34; and &#34;6&#34;, which are pretty big and very easy to read. And the FCB logo at the 9 o'clock position is a good highlight and it balances the Day/Date window that is on the 3 o'clock position. The two-toned color band makes the perfect match with the watch.<br />I also like it as an automatic movement watch instead of digital. Even thought it is not as accurate as digital watch but the mechanical ticking sound shows the time goes second by second, which is very cool. Actually, this automatic watch runs fairly accurate. It only goes a few seconds fast everyday. And I like the brand Seiko because they make excellent time pieces.\n",
            "The watch itself appears fine but I returned it as it was once again (i.e., along with what seems to be a universal fad) too thick, too heavy, too large.<br />Skagen watches seem to be the ONLY company with any sense of elegance - clean, thin, uncluttered, certainly durable watches.  The rest of the market seem to consist of sheep (pigs?) hungry for the &#34;manly, manly&#34; (?) appearance well calculated for the primitives increasingly making up the &#34;latest&#34;.  Quality is not really in question so much as style.\n",
            "Excellent!\n",
            "It is a beautiful looking watch. My one issue with it is the hour hand seems slightly behind always so when it is on the hour it looks like it is still approaching the hour.\n",

            "Very nice quality.  This is the second Tense watch I purchased.\n",
            "This watch is great for the price. Fits really well, and the band feels like it will last a long time. I really like the gun metal look to it. It is shinny like the picture. Looks a lot better than the pictures show in my opinion. The functions are very basic but that's what i wanted for 14 bucks. the light works really well, and you can read the screen easily in daylight. Great watch. I have only had it for about a month so we will see how long it lasts.\n",
            "That's awesome\n",
            "Thanks Nice one\n",
            "Beautiful watch and outstanding price. Bought this for a gift and would love to have one for myself.\n",
            "Very well built watch, many cool features!\n",
            "This watch is pretty.  It fits my wrist better than my others.  I have a small wrist.  Wear it every day and it still looks new.  At first it was hard to read the time because it is black, but got used to it and no problem. Will order the same watch in brown soon.  The times are perfect and never needs batteries.\n",
            "This is a very nice watch for the price.  Like other reviewers stated it was more impressive in person than in the pictures on Amazon.  The case that it comes in is very well made and it appears to be genuine leather on the inside.  First impression of the watch is that it was smaller/narrower than I expected it to be...but that is actually a good thing as it is an excellent size for my girlfriend's smaller wrist.  The white parts of the band are made of ceramic and not plastic which is a nice touch.  The crystals that surround the watch give it a very nice classy look and not a cheap look that some low-end rhinestone watches put off.  In fact that was a big concern of mine when ordering this watch is that it would look cheap but in truth that is quite the opposite after seeing it in person.<br /><br />As with most watches you will likely need to take it to a jeweler to have the watch band fitted unless you have the tools and/or know how to fit a watch band.  Most places like kiosks in mall department stores are willing to do this for free or a very minimal cost.<br /><br />To top it off this watch comes with a limited lifetime warranty.  Time will tell how the watch holds up but all first impressions are excellent and my girlfriend absolutely loves it.  I felt like I got a great deal and it was an excellent gift.\n",
            "It's beautiful but heavy and not great for running.\n",

            "Do not buy this item it is a just a piece os plastic trash does nothing. Very cheap.\n",
            "This is a beautiful watch with the stainless steel frame and blue dials.  I am a fan of Swiss Legend watches since the one I purchased from Amazon last year that looks great and is extremely accurate.  These watches use a swiss quartz movement which is usually battery powered, not movement/kinetic powered.  My other Swiss Legend watch uses a battery and I do not have to rewind it or reset it to keep it on time.  I prefer the battery powered to a kinetic because if you don't wear it for a few days, it still keeps time.  Also, the latches on the watch work perfectly.  The watch is easy to take off by just pressing on both sides of the band.  I have never had mine ever release accidentally.   These are large watches and fairly heavy so keep that in mind.  Other than that, they are excellent quality watches for a great price!\n",
            "Good pins, work well and as advertised.\n",
            "Cheap fake leather. The watch face has bubbles underneath the surface. Otherwise, it's a basic functional watch that needs time adjustment daily.\n",
            "Great looking watch for the money, it's very pretty on, received many compliments.\n",
            "It's the only place I can buy this Watch. I really love it.\n",
            "I own two other skagen watches, both of which have very thin cases. I was attracted to this watch design looking at the pictures but once I received the watch, I noticed that the case was a lot thicker than my other 2 skagen watches, probably a couple of millimeters more. It was a deal breaker for me because even though I liked the color of the face and design, I didn't like how thick the case looked was from the side. It's also a big heavier so I returned it.\n",
            "I like it  My favor brand are Swiss army thank you\n",
            "The watch look good but is small .but good price ,\n",
            "Excellent product !!\n",
            "Fossil Makes Great Stuff. I love the size of this watch in regards to my wrist size, Tan leather band gives off a professional look, I can wear this with classy clothes or with daily clothes. I've gotten a lot of compliments.\n",

            "Great value! Would buy again.\n",
            "A great watch for the money, solar, never needs batteries...  but, if you want to retain the water resistance you still need to bring it in for new gaskets. Warning! For those with sensitive skin the band does include a anti-bacterial coating!\n",
            "A nice clock, sounds nice when it chimes, Looks good, and the price is right.\n",

            "Purchased for my 13 yr old grandson and he love the watch\n",
            "Solid links, comfortable to wear and improves the watch's looks. I use it on a Black Invicta Force 1517 to replace the &#34;Techno Fiber&#34; covered leather band.  Deployment is faster than the factory leather band and no sweat stains. The finish will wear off, but at nine bucks - I'll get a few.... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FN00PM?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00\n",

            "Purchased this for my husband for our anniversary and I had it engraved.  It is simply a beautiful time piece that looks really expensive.  When I gave it to him, he was cautiously like &#34;Whoa this is heavy how much did you spend?&#34;, but he can access my Amazon account, so he found out the true cost, so for the price, this is a great buy.\n",

            "Easy to handle, does what it should do. Would buy it again.\n",
            "My husband love this.\n",
            "Big, bulky watch with a band that barely fits.  Uncomfortable to wear, but seems durable and was inexpensive.  Not what I thought I was getting.\n",
            "Perfect!\n",
            "Ordered two of these and had to send both back because the second hand and analog part did not work , and the tag inside said it had been tested.\n",

            "Nice\n",

            "Great watch for the price\n",
            "Just an all round quality build , like the leather , everything works fine but the lower right button only has one feature but other than that its cool\n",
            "We saw a demonstration of these clocks, and they are extremely interesting to watch.  They are not a run of the mill clock with hourly chime.  There are various songs, and the parts to the clock brake apart to reveal further ornamentation.  Please note that what appears to be the stock photograph is actually upside down.  The parts that say 11 12 1 should actually be at the top and all parts spin around to form the clock fact, once hourly chime is complete.\n",
            "So, maybe I'm an old lady by doing this, but I love doing matchy-matchy.  Not so much with clothes, but I have this weird compulsion to have my watch match my handbag and/or my shoes.  I got a killer handbag from The Sak that is exactly this color.  Whether or not it's a style don't, it looks terrific together.<br /><br />I wear mostly jeans and accessories that are navy, turquoise, teal or lime.  This works with all of them.  The color is deep and I really like it.<br /><br />The price was great too. The last watch I bought was a nice Fossil in camel leather but I realized when it comes down to it, price isn't that much of a factor. I've given up on Fossil and would rather have something like this that I can replace in the Spring when I go for another handbag.\n",

            "Very nice watch for the price. I had to remove 3 links for the watch band to fit right. Here is the link for the how to video if you need to remove links http://youtu.be/WuyRHCenVdA If you mess up you can buy replacement watch bands at meijer for $8. That's what happened to me but it turned out perfect. Indiglo works good too.\n",

            "awesome\n",
            "This watch, even though is described as a men's watch, it's too small size for men. This style it's more for women, due to it's size itself and the size of the belt.\n",
            "Great watch. One year later, I wouldn't dive with it. It's pretty and fairly durable and very comfortable. I'm a big guy and it doesn't look too small or too big on my wrist. Goes good with almost any occasion.\n",
            "Very badly constructed. Would not close or fit together at closure.  Just very poor workmanship.\n",
            "It is a great value and is very quiet.  I think our only complaint is that its not as Ebony as described rather its more of a dark brown with black in it.\n",

            "Great watch for the price.\n",
            "I have many Invicta watches now and I really love this one.  I like the uniqueness of the movement, the fact that the face and hands glow in the dark.  Feels nice on the wrist.  I have another 52mm Pro Diver (Automatic with the open heart), so I knew it would be a comfortable watch to wear.\n",

            "As a Rolex watch, it is the best. You cannot go wrong with Rolex. But the dial color with the seaweed green lettering is a swing and a miss. Go with black dial and this watch is a masterpiece.\n",
            "Molding of the steel casing is poor, chronograph buttons are flimsy, glass cover over the dial is cloudy and has really poor viewing angles. In just the right light, it is a good looking watch. But I suppose you just have to hold it correctly...\n",
            "excellent\n",
            "The watch exemplifies excellence in watch making and design. The watch is beautiful. Classy...sporty and elegant at the same time. However if you require luminescence for telling the time at dark  this watch has none.  If you have only one watch for all occaisons...this should be it. I love this watch!\n",
            "This is a lovely, small watch. But it is heavy, and I'm not enjoying it quite as much as I thought I would. The clasp is sometimes uncomfortable. But I am a sensitive person so other people might not even notice these things.\n",

I also tried setting the day &amp; date for the watch but ended up ripping out the crown of the watch. I'm giving it 3 stars simply because It's beautiful enough for everyday use\n",
            "very good A\n",
            "Something is wrong with this sale. First off, the owner couldn't have owned this watch for 30 years as this model came out in 2008. Secondly it is listed as a &#34;DeepSea&#34; model which it is not. Something is fishy.\n",
            "I bought this watch and does not include the certificate of authenticity of diamonds. Can you help me ?? thanks\n",

            "Comfortable watch to wear and it looks nice\n",
            "I like my pebble SO much more because of this band. The metal is a bit too shiny and I removed one of the pieces because I didn't find a use for it and didn't like the way it looked. Too my surprise, it was difficult to remove which supports the fact it's quality construction! Great upgrade on the pebble!\n",

            "too small\n",
            "The watch is pretty and works well... however, the gold plated case is horrible. Actually all gold-plated case is tarnished with black color.. it looks like a piece of junk. So I had to polish with Silvo. After I polished it looks much better, but still it has some spots and stains... Do not buy a gold one!!\n",

            "Smaller and more feminine-looking than expected. Good watch otherwise.\n",
            "Pretty watches but quit working on the second day.  Hour hand wouldn't move and wouldn't keep time. I've purchased items from a bubble gum machine that lasted longer.\n",

            "Dad love his watch, it's easy to read and that is what he needed.\n",
            "Very nice looking watch. That aside, the feel is very cheap when compared to equally priced 'invicta' watches (of which I've owned 3). The steel band is also a hair puller, ouch! Bought it as a lightning deal.\n",
            "Watch's band rippes after less than a week... Very flimsy... Nice watch but very bad quality\n",
            "I have only had the watch for a few months, I tired to reset the date and the crown came completely off, now the watch is completly useless to me. To Invicta, it's to bad that your watches don't last as good as they look.<br />Singhed....Really Dissapointed.\n",
            "i have had mine for 5 yrs and its still working great<br />and I'm glad to say to others that ask that its waterproof, and really you don't have to take it off for anything.\n",
            "good product\n",
            "Looks good, but my daughter could not set it because there were no instructions! Also, the writing on the watch is tiny no matter what the photo shows!\n",
            "I received my order two days before my delivery date. I like this watch a little big but fit my wrist It is a classy dress or sport I received compliments very regular. The design is great and very easy to setup I will recommend this to everyone. My only negative when I received my watch it went on sales two days later. Great watch great company!\n",
            "This necklace was a bit smaller than I imagined it would be, but it is exactly as shown and quite beautiful! Perfect to wear for my &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; themed Bridal Shower coming up!\n",
            "Not bad for the price.<br />Takes a little to figure out how to set the time because the instructions are limited.<br />Much lighter than my Invicta of the same size as this feels like aluminum.<br />LED's don't look that great in the light but are way better in the dark.<br />We'll see how long it lasts...\n",

            "Beautiful cool and modern watch, very stylish easy to wear with a sport to casual look, highly recommended it, you won't be disappointed\n",
            "Excellent watch looks great. Careful if you're buying it for an outside job tho, the canvas strap tends to hold onto the outside world. Other than that tho, great durable and classic.\n",
            "received on time . Good product\n",
            "Worth the cheap price--but then again you get what you pay for. Looks really nice and has even been mistaken for an Apple watch, but the silicon band got a tear after only the second wear. Not durable enough to be something you would wear everyday.\n",
            "Watch came on time easy instructions and works perfect.. Wow! And stylish a lot of compliments.\n",
            "This was a gift fort boyfriend and it's perfect. The last one I got from another seller had a broken clasp. This one has a real watch type mesh band it works perfect\n",
            "This watch is a functional awesome machine.  The rubber watch band is a godsend for me because, I have severe metal allergies must be an autistic werewolf thing. ...joke... The watch is both big and heavy by most typical human standards so if you don't like a very big heavy watch then this is not the watch for you. Now I love a big watch and the weight that goes with it.  I don't want a watch so light I forget it is on my wrist.  Also I like a watch that has features large enough for me to see easily.  On those rare occasions when my eyes are doing well I can see the 24 hour clock embedded on the face of the watch.  The high contrast white on black face with a touch of red makes this watch easy to use and nice to look at.  Seeing the date in the bubble takes some training but it was not an issue. The watch appears durable and  having cerebral palsy means I'm not totally easy on any watch.\n",
            "love it\n",
            "Very cheaply made. It is very old and rusty.\n",
            "My daughter likes this.  Unfortunate that the band is so big.  She is an average sized 7 year old and has the band on the last hole.  It still is loose.\n",
            "beautiful watch, though very large.  fits well,comfortable.  date function is virtually invisible to me.  the topaz stones are beautiful and really make the watch stand out from the plain stainless ones.  it would be perfect if it were actually a sport watch instead of just a fashion watch.\n",
            "Bought this watch on my granddaughter's 13th birthday. She is a batman fan.<br />She loves this gift and is flaunting this watch in school. Other batman fan children were looking at her with envy.<br />The watch has luminous hour and minute hands. Probably, if the batman logo also glowed it would have been awesome.\n",

            "Great product!\n",
            "This is an outstanding watch that keeps excellent time. As the old Timex ads said &#34;It takes a lickin and keeps on tickin&#34;. The watch is very sturdy without being clunky.\n",
            "This watch is not black (as pictured) it is actually a gunmetal grey.  In sunlight it is a medium gray color.  Nonetheless, it is a beautiful watch.  I wanted it to match my black titanium with gold inlay wedding band, not quite - but it comes close.  The watch is substantial and made of very high quality material.  The finish is nice and I love the size, as I have big hands.\n",
            "Love the Invicta's\n",
            "When I receive it , I found it amazing , I Like the color of iwatch band\n",
            "A big disappointment. Had the watch just for about 2 1/2 months and the watch has been worn 4 times and is already changing colors. Didn't get any paperwork on it when I received the watch. That was not a cheap watch, so I wouldn't advise anybody to buy the watch because the don't want to stand behind their product.\n",
            "Band serves its purpose.<br />Looks relatively decent on my EcoDrive Dress watch.<br /><br />Only complaint is that the finish on the leather seems rather rough.\n",

I only wear it on Friday's when I'm riding the motorcycle to work so I get about 30min of sun in the morning and 30min in afternoon.  Then maybe another 2hrs of sun on the weekend while surfing.  The rest of the time it is in my bedroom which has the shades closed so doesn't get any sunlight.  However, the battery indicator has always been on high.\n",
            "Great item!  The necklace has this little book that opens up and, inside, there is a watch.  My teenage daughter just loved this!  She wore it to school and her friends thought it was awesome.  Lots and lots of compliments.  They are all Death Note fans but, this is a very cool item even if you are not.

I bought 3 no-name brand from Ebay for $7.95 each that has what I wanted and it works fine.  The bluest light is not glaring at all during the night.  Still a good product though.

I Buy from Amazon partly for the ease of returns so I didn't read the return policy.  I should have.  It had to be returned within thirty days,apparently defective or not. I'm Now stuck with a defective watch that can't be returned. It's no longer the Amazon I've known and loved.\n",

            "My watch came with black plastic components on the sides. The Picture of the watch does not show black plastic components on the sides of the watch, it shows steel. However,  I did a SCUBA dive in the Atlantic Ocean two weeks ago off the coast of Wilmington, NC with this watch at a depth of 50 feet with no problems for 80 minutes.  The bezel is solid and the dial shows up well in the water.  The 50 mm dial isn't too big even for people with small wrists and fits easily over a dive suit.  I wouldn't want to wear this as an everyday watch but it's perfect for diving and monitoring how long you've been underwater, so you can monitor how long your air supply is lasting.  I would recommend this watch to anyone who didn't want to spend several hundred dollars on a dive watch strictly for the purposes of diving. This watch is very rugged and I look forward to using it again on future dives.\n",
            "A++++++\n",
            "I like the watch and look good\n",
            "it's a good price for a swiss made watch, but it's very heavy and very thick watch it needs a very huge man to wear it.<br />for that i return it\n",
            "Great watch overall!  The watch is a little bit on the heavy side, but is very classy.  My only complaint is that in some lighting situations there is not a lot of contrast between the hands and the background so seeing the time is not always that easy. However, I'm very pleased with it and would buy another one if I had to.\n",
            "I have mixed emotions about the watch. The first one they sent me came unceremoniously packaged in a zip-lock plastic bag and ran 7 minutes fast a day. Amazon replaced that watch and I had a new one within a couple of days; even before I had returned the first one. The replacement watch works great and keeps almost perfect time. (Incidentally, it arrived in a nice Seiko box, like you would expect from a department store).<br /><br />I bought the watch because I’ve been wearing one just like it that I got 40 years ago. To have that one cleaned and regulated however, would have cost more than the new watch. In essence, I really like the watch and all its’ features. The only thing I don’t like about it is that I can’t set the second hand. Pulling the stem out doesn’t stop it. On my old watch, and on the first (faulty) one they sent me, you could halt the second hand by putting back pressure on the crown (as if you were going to turn the hands backwards), and set the second hand that way. I can’t do that on the replacement watch. I just have to accept where it’s at. Consequently, I can expect this new watch to accurately and consistently indicate the same 21 seconds fast each day. If that won’t bother you, then I think you’ll like the watch. Assuming, that is, that you don’t get a lemon like the first one they sent me.\n",

            "First off, if you're looking at purchasing an Invicta watch, know that the List Price is a completely arbitrary number designed to make you think you're getting a really good deal, &#34;Hey look, I can get this thousand dollar watch for only $130!&#34;. That being said, this watch appears to be worth the $130 price tag. Aesthetically, the watch seems really well made; the strap is of good quality, the stainless steel back is nicely etched, the case seems to be machined from a solid chunk steel, and the face employs a real piece of carbon fiber that gives off a nice 3D sheen. I am currently on my second sample though, the first sample had a defective tachometer which included an inability to reset back to the zero position. The first watch also had a chip of paint missing from the red spring at the bottom end of it. My second sample seems to work well, although I noticed the paint was also chipping off on the red springs which appears to be from the metal ends of the straps rubbing against them (I included an image of the chipped spring for reference). For me, any design that causes wear from normal usage is a design flaw. Also, you see the little red O-ring on the crown? You WILL lose that the first time you put it on. I lost mine twice on the first day but miraculously found it both times it fell off. I didn't put it back on a third time. The Tritnite glow in the dark dial glows a nice blue color, but it's barely visible, even after getting hours of light. I have not yet decided if I'll keep the watch or return it for a different one.\n",

Adjusting the size by removing links was not quite as easy as you would think, but with the right tools is not too difficult.<br />  The digital display is very easy to read in bright light, or direct sunlight.  In dim conditions it is almost impossible to see without using the built in light.\n",
            "I used to LOVE Timex, and in particular this watch.  I've owned three of them, this being my third. The others lasted for years and were indestructible.  The fit is great, it's not too big or bulky so I had planned to stick with this line of watches indefinitely.  I purchased this particular watch about a year ago when my previous Timex went missing.  However, I located the missing watch and this one stayed in its box until about 2 weeks ago.  To be very clear - THE WATCH IN QUESTION HAS BEEN WORN FOR TWO WEEKS.  IT HAS OTHERWISE SAT IN ITS ORIGINAL PACKAGING IN MY HOUSE.  In those two weeks, this watch has been on several runs, no water activities.  This Saturday, I went for my usual run but also waded in the river.  The watch is now useless - water leaked under the screen and it's now all fogged.  For a TRIATHALON training watch...ie, a sport that INCLUDES PROLONGED SWIMMING.... this is unacceptable and despicable.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH.  It is not worth it - I know that it's not expensive, but if you have to replace a watch every 2 weeks, suddenly $40 adds up.  It's a shame - Timex used to be a brand you can trust, but something has changed on the manufacturing side of things and this watch is worthless now.  And, lucky me, it's outside the return window, so I'm just out the money and I have no watch.  Don't make the same mistake - buy something else.<br /><br />Photo: 2 days later after sitting in a bag of rice - screen still totally fogged although the water is gone.\n",

I want to invest in a much nicer watch, but needed something inexpensive in the meantime. Considering it was going to be replaced I didn't see the point in investing too much in a temporary watch. This watch looks good, is inexpensive, and functionality is great.\n",

This watch looks cheap and during sweaty times it itches the skin. Setting analog time is a pain and the backlight is hopeless. So, I neither found class nor functionality in this watch. You are better-off buying another non-Casio watch at same price or +-$5.\n",

I regret not ordering the similar tool set with case. Still, one trip to the jeweler and it's paid for so no gripe here. I'm ready to buy more watches.

            "This watch is huge! For me personally, that makes it a little too showy; but if you like a watch with a big, conspicuous face, this is for you. Also please note that while anyone could wear the watch, it is designed especially for left-handed people. It looks like a high class watch and has a lot of helpful functionality. Even though its oversize look doesn't suit my taste and style, I'm giving it four stars because it's meant to look that way and I think it will please anyone who is comfortable with its size.\n",

            "This is hands down the best Seiko diver I have ever owned, and the second best dive watch I own, (sorry Seiko, my Submariner still holds first place). Firstly, this watch is very comfortable to wear. The titanium feels very light and smooth on the skin. You can almost forget you're wearing it. The face is very legible of course. The lume is bright and long lasting in typical Seiko fashion. This is my first Seiko with a hackable movement which is nice. I can stop the second hand for exact time setting. Of course I don't expect earth shattering accuracy from this automatic movement. I just want a watch that keeps on ticking, and Seiko really delivers here. As a big bold, good looking and very comfortable daily wearer, you would be very hard pressed to find a better watch. I really can't fault this watch.\n",

Don't know that is an everyday watch because it is so big, but it's a great one to add to my husband's collection.  I was hesitant to purchase because of the black (whatever they are) around the face, but I was very pleased that when the watch came, they were very light grey, not black, and don't take away or distract from how beautiful the face of the watch is. I'm posting a picture of it next to another of my husband's watches as a sizing comparison.\n",

            "I had been shopping for a good looking watch for ~$100 for a while and finally stumbled across this. Looks great and so far (after a few days) its been keeping great time. I was worried the size would be too big but it's the perfect size. Anything over 42mm is too big and this seems just right. The leather strap is good quality but I prefer a nato strap for comfort. I had been considering an automatic but I wear watches off and on so wanted to have something I didn't have to worry about re-setting the time or loosing seconds, so the quartz movement on this is great. Chrono works perfect--I like that you can track splits on it and the chrono minute marker is very easy to read so you can track total time. Details of the dial look very high quality, as does the polish on the side of the case.<br /><br />Update - three months later, still going strong. Looses about 10 seconds a month. My Citizen signature looses less, but it cost 7x more.\n",

First, the date window is so small as to be unusable. I've had Lasik surgery and my eyesight is better than 20/20, and I can't read the date. At all. Not even to set it. If you want a watch with the date displayed on the face, then you might want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Second, the band is fairly thick and quite stiff. I'm guessing that will work itself out over time, but it makes it nearly impossible to buckle - and literally impossible to buckle at the correct size for my arm.\n",

I have small wrists which makes wearing the current large watches difficult and bulky.  This is small, but perfect.  I will especially enjoy wearing it with a shirt/tie and jacket or suit.  Very attractive, nice detail, and nicely made.  A very good price for such a nice watch.\n",

            "Update:  You should be aware that while this is a Swiss design, it is manufactured in Asia, like nearly everything these days.  It's similar to an iPhone, which are famously &#34;designed in California, made in China.&#34;  If that matters to you (and it should), you might want to look for something else.  I haven't worn a watch in years.  Frankly, I don't need one and don't need to.  But, years ago, I read an article that when making a first impression, the first things people look at are your teeth, your shoes, and your watch.  My teeth are okay, shoes are always going to be dorky, so I figured maybe I should take the offer on this watch and at least be sure I had 1/3??  It looks much less blue in person, unless I received the wrong model.  Whatever the case, it is quite beautiful.  It's large, mens-style, which makes sense.  Keeps time flawlessly, which you'd expect.    The retail price is like $1000, which is frankly utterly insane.  Even if it were actually made in Switzerland, that would be nuts.  Shop around and wait around, and you should be able to get it for $200 at the most and maybe as little as $99.  I'm not sure what the deal with the mark-up is.  I guess this is technically considered &#34;jewelry,&#34; and that's how jewelry often works.  I don't know if I'd pay more than $100 for it, given where it's made, and we buy way too much stuff made off-shore anyway.  (I have nothing against China, but this practice is not helping them or us.)  If you can find it for a good price, you'll be happy.  It's fantastic quality, good-looking, keeps time perfectly.\n",
            "Just like the original.\n",
            "This watch is not for the faint of heart.  Nothing understated about it -- except for, perhaps, the gray color.  The face is huge -- covers pretty much the entire wrist, at least 2&#34; across, and is quite striking.  The strap is nice and appears to be decent quality leather.  The controls are on the left side of the face rather than the right -- don't know if that would be of some benefit to lefties.  For me it just seemed a little awkward.  What looks like a second hand is actually a stopwatch/timer.  There are two round dials on the lower half of the face. The little dial on the lower left functions as a second hand, making a full rotation every 60 seconds.  The little dial on the lower right rotates every thirty minutes.  Overall, this is an attractive watch with some unusual features.  You'll have no trouble seeing the dials!\n",
            "slim, has all the pertinent  components, well made\n",
            "I Love the watch. It match the color of my blouse.\n",

            "awesome watches.  beautiful and i get lots of compliments.  i want to order them in every color.\n",
            "It's okay I guess. I mean, I just use it as an everyday watch, but not to anything that requires me to dress up. I kinda have to wear it nearly everyday otherwise it'll stop on it's own...<br /><br />Kinda my fault anyway as this is my first mechanical watch and I'm used to watches going on and on by itself without having to move it around just to keep it going.<br /><br />I saw all the great reviews and bought it based on that. There's one born every minute...\n",
            "Bought this as a gift for my 8 yr old nephew.  He loved it!\n",
            "another quality G-Shock watch - I got this for my 8 year old son - fits him perfectly and he loves the bright colours.My only complaint is that the light could be much MUCH better.\n",
            "Good for the price! Feels a little cheap compared to other high priced watches, but I've gotten used to it.\n",
            "Great watch. Maybe a little expensive for what it is. It's actually a real chronograph. The reason I gave it 3 stars is that the 1/10 of a second dial does not center properly when reset. For a watch of this price I expected better quality.\n",
            "With the advent of &#34;smart&#34; watches (and &#34;smart&#34; everything else), I've come to a new appreciation of the analog world. I'm a technophile and considered buying an Apple Watch, but a &#34;real&#34; watch makes more sense to me, even though I depend on my iPhone. I don't want to become even more tethered to my phone!<br /><br />This Swiss Legend watch has a thoroughly classic look, and I've always been partial to a black watch face with white markings. As others have mentioned, some were surprised that this watch seems larger than normal, but one can easily see what it will look like before buying. Have a look at the fourth image above, which is pretty accurate in terms of how it will look on most guys. (Small or very thin men might want to look for a watch with a smaller face.) Although large, this is not the heaviest watch I've owned. The weight of this one seems just right and reminds me that it's not made as cheaply as my old Timex from Walmart. The natural tan watchband is very attractive and feels good (I'm not at all fond of metal bands). Although I'm right-handed, I also appreciate the fact that the adjustment crown and push buttons are on the left side, especially given the size of this watch and the main crown. In my experience, the crown can dig into the back of my hand when, say, leaning on a desk or otherwise bending my hand back. I don't find the placement of the crown inconvenient, and the push buttons feel natural in that position.<br /><br />Though this is by no means a Rolex, the feel and look of this watch suggests quality, especially given the price of less than $100. There are indeed many watches to choose from, and one's choice may well depend on numerous factors, perhaps style foremost. In my opinion, this watch is a winner in both function and looks. It's not extremely conservative, nor does it flash too many colors and gizmos. It seems just about right for almost any setting or situation.\n",
            "I have received the watch and I loved it so much and loved the luxury look, but the watch didn't work. I'm not sure if it's from the battery or not?! I have to spend extra money to see if it's working.<br /><br />I would give this watch 5 stars, but why should I spend this $$$ for a DEAD WATCH\n",
            "Very fashionable! Only 4 stars because the battery died a week after getting it.\n",
            "I actually bought and own the PMV65-2271 instead of 2272 as listed here. They are very much the same, JDM, U660 movement, Duratec MRK coating (some DLC element on 2272). The only different is the band and the slide bezel ruler. The watch actually wear much smaller than the dimensions I found on the internet. I own the Seiko Sumo so I'm used to seeing large watch on my wrist, I guess. The watch receive signal almost every night. Sometimes the weather is bad at night and the watch unable to receive any signal. However, receiving signal during daytime is not a problem at all. Truth to be told, the watch receive signal much better on a ceramic surface (table tops, sinks) than elsewhere. Really weird. My theory is that while surround by ceramic material, signal interference is less. One other thing I must mention is that the Duratec MRK is amazing! I baby all of my watches and all of them receive scratches. The exception is this one. The only scratches I can see are around the inside of the clasp, where metal meet metal. Otherwise, the watch look about the same as the day I received it some 2 months ago. No wonder this watch cost much more than similar watch with the same movement and case. I wonder if Citizen will put its latest Duratec coating, alpha, on this model in the future. Before Duratec alpha came out, MRK is the best that Citizen offered.\n",
            "I love the color of this watch (sort of like a wintergreen color that pops) and its simple functionality. What you get for the cost is pretty good in terms of value and it's a nice, stylish product. Includes your typical stopwatch/timer function and the ability to save several time zones if you're a jet setter of sorts.\n",
            "It's a very cute watch.  I trusted the Timex name an assumed it would arrive functional.  But...I was wrong. The backing doesn't fit the watch. It was held in place by the removable band, so it kept stopping because the battery kept getting loose. I can't get the backing on. it just doesn't fit.  I threw away the packaging, so I can't even return it. What a waste. Not sure if this is a problem for Timex or a problem for the seller.  NEVER going to use this service again.\n",
            "This is an amazingly good watch - in fact, this is my second one, replacing the first which rapidly became my &#34;most-days watch&#34; for a year and a half.  Unfortunately, I managed to somehow tear mine off after sailing a few weeks ago (it's plenty waterproof if you're not diving), and after debating buying a different watch, decided to buy an exact duplicate of the one I lost.  (If anyone finds one of these near the Austin YC ramp, I'd love to have it back...)  The fact that I bought one again says it all, but read on for the details of why.<br /><br />I love everything about this watch:  The size (not too big/thick/heavy, like many current watches), the clean understated simplicity of the design (at less than 2% of the cost of a Bremont Solo), the band (I wish I could buy this exact band as a replacement - I was looking for a replacement but hadn't found one yet when I lost mine), the color, the face, the timekeeping, the day/date, the more comfortable  4-o'clock location of the crown, and the cool glass back to see the inner workings.  The stamping finish on the movement is the one of the only three things that sort-of tip off the lower price of this watch.  (Interestingly, the finish on my new one is now much better than it was on my previous one, so apparently this bugged somebody at Seiko, too.  But I'm an engineer, and nitpicky about this stuff...)  The second thing is that the luminous material on the hands and face could stand to be a bit better, and the last is that the Hardlex crystal is pretty tough, but obviously, at this price point, not sapphire.  I don't baby my watches - in fact, I tend to (inadvertently) beat the tar out of them, and this watch has proved to be quite good at handling real life.<br /><br />The Seiko 5's have a very nice automatic-winding movement (no batteries!), and my previous one kept ridiculously good time - after settling in for a few months (I wouldn't recommend adjusting the timekeeping until after that even if you're the sort who tends to tweak watches), it was keeping time almost as well as a quartz watch or at least, a COSC chronometer - under 2 seconds a day! (I realize my new one is unlikely to be quite that good, but I can hope...)  Seiko does not sell the 5 in the US, but buying it through Amazon gives you a valid US warranty - not that you're likely to need it.  Seiko has always been known for great-quality mid-range and high-end watches (both quartz and mechanical), but the Seiko 5 series is proof that even their low-end mechanical watches are of extremely high quality.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.sort who tends to tweak watches), it was keeping time almost as well as a quartz watch or at least, a COSC chronometer - under 2 seconds a day!

I own more expensive watches automatic watches (Cartier, Rolex, Tag Heuer) and I feel the quality and look of this watch is right there with my more expensive watches.  I did some research and settled on this watch because the look and style reminds me of my Omega Seamaster.  I think this watch is ideal for someone who wants a quality watch for day to day wear without having to worry about watch damage and wear and tear.

The Soho collection watches wrap around 3 times rather than 2 (and so, the picture isn't accurate since that shows the traditional double wrap style). I just got the watch and it's a bit stiffer than I expected, but since it's suede, I'm thinking it'll loosen up quickly. I have tiny wrists and wear it on the 2nd-to-tightest hole (normally with La Mer I have to wear it on the tightest one). Really cool style and I'm excited to wear it!\n",

Also, it does not have pins holding the band on - it is solid metal.The band is a bit stiff, but it also dries quickly and you can just rise it if it gets sweaty or soiled, though nothing seems to show on it.I like the way the set screw is inset and offset.  Note that the setting screw screws down tight, and you gave to remember to do that after setting the time to make the watch water resistant.  Otherwise water will get into the case.  Warnings to this effect come with the product.  Oh yes, it also keeps good time.  I also like that there are a lot of other bands you can get for this watch if you want to change things up.\n",

The pins that came with the new band were to long but fortunately I was able to use the old pins. Bottom line is I made this band work but again it is NOT &#34;one size fits&#34; all.\n",
            "My husband bought this for me as a Valentine's gift two years ago. I love it. I wear it everyday and only take it off to shower. I have received many compliments on it from many different people.  All the &#34;diamonds&#34; are still intact, the color is still gold, and the inside of the band is smooth and not one bit rough which tends to happen with cheap watches. Obviously I never have to change the battery and the occasional water to it has not affected it at all.  The only problem I have with it, is being an active person the watch tends to be fast as I am moving a lot. I would buy a second watch in a heartbeat if something happened to the first. Very impressed. :)\n",
            "These casio watches are very nice. You notice that watch was plural because I have bought four of them and I love all of them.\n",

            "Great Watch So Far Distinctive Face And Came quickly 2 day shipping ..Really Fine looking watch without a huge face, Quite Classy ,Love the day on top Feature ...all In  all Highly Recommended!\n",
            "Awesome\n",
            "good\n",
            "Purchased this as an anniversary gift and my boyfriend absolutely loves it. Great size, not too big, and very sleek. He LOVES the color, and also loves the sturdy box it came in that he can reuse for travel. It's a dress up or casual watch- and just perfect for or occasion. You also CANNOT beat the price.\n",
            "It's a great watch considering the price.\n",
            "I love the sportylook,  the gold colored gears inside the face,  the sturdy band that keeps it secure around my wrist... I truly Love this watch\n",
            "This is basically a Citizen movement in a generic case. I have the exact same watch inan Invicta. It is a modified Citizen Campanola movement. Bulova has the exactly same watch also called a precissionist.\n",
            "My wife Loves it so far!\n",
            "The world time zone map is too small to read properly. The SEARCH button can be pressed accidentally if the watch is pressed against the back of your hand, which happens quite often. Every time I look at the watch to see the time, I have to press the SEARCH button multiple times to get back to the current time zone. It would've been better if the MODE and the SEARCH buttons were swapped.\n",
            "Absolutely perfect watch. I really am enjoying it. The atomic feature makes it truly maintenance free.\n",
            "Well built watch. Arrived in good time considering distance travel.  This is a large watch bear that in mind if your are thinking of buying one\n",
            "Excellent!  My 6 year old grandson loved this!  His Mom was thrilled with how fast and easy he learned to tell time!  He announces the time all day long!  Great watch!\n",
            "Cute watch.  I'm not used to this type of band, so it took some getting used to.\n",
            "This is hands down the best watch quality to price ratio I've ever seen. It keeps time perfectly, the stop watch works incredibly well, and is frighteningly precise. I also think it's gorgeous. If I had to come up with anything negative, all I can think of is it's a bit heavy. If I could add any custom feature it would be luminox style crystals to read it a little better at night. Other than that, it's my favorite watch in my collection.\n",
            "this is the best watch i have ever owned.  I had one just like this one and it got broken and I saw this one and I ordered it quickly.  Now I have my watch back.  Great watch!!\n",

            "not bad. get what you pay for\n",
            "Very nice watch. Dial is still very small for this type of watch, but still easy to read, and looks good on small wrists. Entire watch face is luminous (hands are dark), which is a different twist. Watch band was not very easy to remove links from; pin holes seemed smaller than usual, and required a very fine driver to knock out.\n",
            "Got these for my daughter who is a fan of Full Metal Alchemist, she is very pleased with them. We received both the silver and the black pocket watch. Shipping was extremely fast, and they came packaged in a small jewelry box separated by foam. The quality to detail on the watches, makes up for the cheaper material. My daughter definitely recommends them for any fan of the show.<br /><br />* I received the item at discount in exchange for my honest review. *\n",
            "A very nice and promising product. Just as advertised. Good job.\n",
            "This is a beautiful watch. My husband loves it.\n",
            "Good replacement strap. Kind of a tight fit on a Casio classic, but it can be done with a little patience. Having the extra layer between watch and wrist, and the extra folded back takes a little getting used to, but it works well for exercise, which is what I use it for. Excellent customer service.\n",

            "Looks pretty and smart. Good for gift.\n",
            "My grandson loves it...he is 8 and his face exploded with joy. Great product. He wears it swimming and showering.  The only downside is that when his parents tell him he can read for 15 more minutes. .he sets the timer and if they come tell him times up...he shows them..nope...3 more minutes on my watch. (-:\n",

            "The one I purchased quite after only 9 months.  Previous to this I had a gold Timex which lasted about 10 years.  It appears the battery connection was intermittent because it would reset every hour or less.  I purchased another one this time on Amazon.  We will see how this one works out.<br />UPDATE  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WATCH.  I had a Timex that lasted for 10 years, the TWO Casio's did not last.  The first reset to the default time after 9 months, the second had the same problem after 17 months.  I changed my review from two stars to ONE star.\n",
            "I purchased this for my six year old who loves trains. It is a functional watch and has a very nice look to it. The cover is easy to open. My son adores it and loves to use it when he is pretending to be a train conductor.\n",

            "Disappointed. Good looking face but the band was super thin a felt very cheap. Returned\n",
            "This time piece is perfect. The 48mm size is a nice over sized look with out being too extreme. The weight of the watch is surprisingly on the lighter side, matched with the leather band makes a nice fit on the wrist. This is my third Stuhrling and really happy with the quality of the brand. Get compliments all the time when wearing a Stuhrling watch.\n",

            "I love watched so I was happy when I was able to buy this one at a great price.  It is so pretty and will go with any outfit I wear.  If you know watches you know that Geneva is a great brand and will last a very long time.  When I received my watch it was set and ready to go.  I even bought 3 extra so that I can use them as gifts.  What I liked about this watch is that is a silicone band and it did not make my wrist sweet at all.  I did receved this nice watch at a discount price for my honest review.\n",
            "As one reviewer wrote already, the removable &#34;pillow&#34; doesn't fit snug enough into the winder to securely hold a heavier watch like the larger metal Rolexes. You will need to stuff cotton balls Or some wadding into the sides or rig up some rubber bands--unacceptable. Poor design. The construction is cheap. It is cheap plastic and looks like Chinese junk like most things from China. The winder last a few years with very limited use. Do not buy this. You will be disappointed.\n",

            "I wasn't expecting much.  Basically wanted a watch that didn't have the fake leather strap that disintegrates is a few months.<br />the problem with this watch is the strap.  It is ultra-thin and flimsy.  This makes it difficult to put on.  I had to develop a whole new level of dexterity to get the thing on.  Each a chore each time.\n",
            "Amazing design, I just loved this watch.\n",

            "I bought this for my son as a Christmas gift. (2014)<br />Looks decent, he loved it. He has worn this watch selectively. Unfortunately it stopped working after 6 months.<br />I have owned and worn other Swiss watches in my collection, this one looks expensive and decent, but feels cheaply made.<br />It is all show, and no craftsmanship at all. Swiss watches will last for years if not generations. It is not even worth the price I paid, it is not even worth $20. Warranty is just a joke; prepaid return shipping is $20, plus the cost of mailing it to them; all this for a watch that is not even worth $20.<br />This is the second watch we own in the family from the same brand and company. Mine failed within 3 months of scant usage.<br />Buyers beware! don't be fleeced. Spend your money wisely.\n",

            "I was happy with this watch until today. Out of blue it has generated some moisture inside. Seller recommended that I should contact manufacturer i.e. Casio.\n",
            "Quality watch, well made good features.\n",

            "This is a cute, nicely functioning watch that our school-teacher daughter grabbed up and claimed as her own. She needed a newer, nicer watch to wear to the classroom, and this watch fit her needs perfectly.<br /><br />This battery-powered watch keeps good time, is lightweight and is comfortable to wear. The strap adjusts easily to wrist size, and the underside of the watch is nicely curved to fit well against the shape of the wrist.<br /><br />The Amazon listing notes that a 2 year warranty is available through the Amazon Asurion program, so if an issue occurs before that period expires I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.<br /><br />If you are looking for fun, cute battery operated watch of this size and style, for use as I have described above, then our daughter would recommend giving this watch a try based on her experience with it (she kept it and took it home with her).<br /><br />Very recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience.\n",
            "Excellent\n",
            "I like it.  It is the right size, somewhat larger than a typical watch but not huge like some of the dive watches.  Nice style, comfortable, easy to read, keeps exact time.  It worked great for kayaking today in rough weather, and I am looking forward to my diving trip.\n",
            "The watch has a beautiful design and understated looks. Each Item of the watch face has a purpose. The numbers are situated where the time is really easy to read.  Please note that the watch band in 20mm and is not 18mm.  I thought the watch band was cheap and I quickly replace it. Even though I use it as my main dress watch, it seems at times the watch can look a little too playful for a dress watch.\n",
            "I use this watch when I have to time something in the shop like all seikos this is a good watch and never disappoints.\n",
            "This watch died within three months. Very disappointing.\n",
            "I liked the design. Setting the temperature was a pain. The biggest problem I had was how uncomfortable the band was. I set everything first and then when I went to put the watch on, I realized that the band was too hard and inflexible to be comfortable.\n",
            "Very large display and easy to read. One star deducted as the face scratches easily. Another deducted as the velcro band wears pretty quickly.\n",
            "Works great\n",

            "Need to returned because has a scratch on the surface\n",

            "I love it ??? Very nice skin line\n",
            "This added just the right length to my watch.\n",
            "I like everything about this watch except for the fact that it was dead on arrival.  The watch would not wind manually, nor would it hold a kinetic wind.  I'm either returning it to buy another brand or giving Invicta another (slim) chance.  It's a shame because this one looks the best out of all the Submariner homages.\n",
            "Pros:<br />- Very easy to read watch face.  Numbers are clear.  Date is easy to read.<br />- Very quite.  You cannot hear any ticking.<br />- Light weight on my arm.<br />- Attractive look for a lower priced watch.  The watch head itself does not look cheap.<br />- Water resistant.<br />- Numbers glow in the dark!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- As others have said before me, the band is cheap.  You will want another band.  Band feels like cheap &#34;leather&#34; and does not bend well.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I for one think this is an impressive watch for a lower price.  While the band can be replaced (and mine will), the watch itself is nice.  I appreciate not having to squint my eyes to look at the face.  The fact that it is water resistant is excellent.\n",
            "I would love it if it would have come with a working battery. I had to pay 9.97 to replace the used battery. Also had to take it to a battery shop to open it and check it because the tab had already been pulled, which tells me it must have been a used watch.\n",
            "First off the items I ordered came pretty quick which was cool.  The watch is actually pretty dope, I had to take out two links for it to fit more firm on my wrist which is why I'm so happy I ordered the HTS 1940HO 16piece watch repair kit, the box of the repair kit tells you what each piece is used for but there are no instructions telling you how to use them but I kinda figured a few out so far.  The watch is really impressive, I'm still trying to figure out some features.  I think I'm ready to shop for some other styles from this brand but it is definitely a man's -man watch\n",
            "This is a great looking watch. I get compliments everywhere i go. Its not very durable though. The glass scratches easily but my main gripe with this watch is that its not waterproof despite the fact that it clearly states 99 feet water resistant. I took a shower with this watch and water started to enter the mechanical parts. I returned this watch 3 times with the same results. I also took it to a watch repair shop to see if they can do anything about it but they told me that they would be afraid to mess with it cause it looks to intricate to mess around with and parts are scarce. I finally just gave up and kept the watch but will not trust it to get wet. Such a shame cause its really a hot looking watch but i shouldn't have to worry about taking it out and ruining it due to rain.\n",
            "I only have one thing to warn about this watch. While it is beautiful and stylish. If you think it's black and gold it is not. Only the face is black. The rest of the links are actually a gray with gold. Not black. it may say that in the description and perhaps I should have read closer. But fair warning the picture could be more accurate of the color in the links\n",
            "Awesome all the way around. Would purchase again but it is a Timex and they last forever.\n",
            "Stopped keeping time after 4 months\n",
            "Got this as a gift for a friend. He loves the weight and feel of the watch, plus it looks great. He wears it almost ever day, couldn't have asked for anything better.\n",
            "I picked this Yellow Hammerhead @ West Marine for 50% off retail online ($62.50) No tax in New Hampshire. When it came in a week later, I was so surprised @ how small it is. No way it's 42mm. The dial/faceplate is more like 40mm (if that) It wears small. I was a skinny wrist so I decided to keep it. The strap is 22mm but it tapers down & it helps with it's small appearance.<br /><br />Pros: Price. Lifetime warranty. Nice aesthetics (@ least for me) Light weight. To my surprise the second hand is dead on with the dial face marks. Very good time keeper overall. So far solid with snorkeling for hours on end. The strap has a really nice feel to it. The lumination feature is worthy & comes in handy. I like the crown, it feels solid.<br /><br />Cons: Date window. Too damn small (why even bother) Setting the date can be a tad tricky sometimes. No manual came with watch. No biggie as I downloaded it from Freestyle's website.<br /><br />I've owned this for about 6 months now. So far so good. I use it as my boat beater watch in the summer in New England. I wouldn't recommend the Hammerhead with a guy with large wrists, it's simply too small. Would I pay retail for this watch? Not in a million years. There are so many other options that blows this timepiece away for $125.00-$150.00 Granted, all of us didn't pay retail price. If this watch was 2mm-3mm larger it would make a big difference. I would categorize this watch as average @ the price I paid. If you can find it cheap, then it might work for some people.<br /><br />Cons:\n",
            "This is a very nice watch for the price. I'm thinking about buying more in different colors.\n",
            "My husband loves his watch...\n",
            "Great watch at a great price. I have no issues with seeing the display. I was looking at G-shocks because I need a rugged product for the line of work im in and the Timex ironman fits the bill. Only time will tell if it holds up\n",
            "I love love love this watch!!\n",
            "what can you complain about with this watch looks great, so far keeping great time nice quality leather band all for 30 bucks im impressed can't go wrong a all.\n",
            "Sturdy and a good value.  I find that the blade can get loose from the handle, since they are replaceable blades.  You can fix it easily with a tiny dab of rubber cement.\n",
            "Very nice. Bit of a learning curve, and some brain power will be used, but it is nice and the timing is accurate.\n",
            "Heavy duty and simple. Just what I wanted.\n",
            "just as described ..... very good buy\n",
            "I really liked the watch and the way it looks and then the battery died after 5 weeks. I have four others and the batteries are all working,  so I don't know what's up with it. I know that I don't want to try and change it.\n",
            "Product description is quite clear that model 4JF is being offered, which is a japan domestic market watch. What you will receive is a model 4DR, which looks the same but is the export model made in Thailand.  Some may argue these are essentially the same watch, but the difference is important to those ordering based on the model number.  Deceptive.\n",
            "I understand that the termin &#34;wet&#34; application scares a lot of people off, but it's really &#34;damp&#34; application, and it's the best way to get a good application.<br />The solution you use is a couple drops of dish soap (not with any lotions or stuff...just regular &#34;lemon-fresh Joy&#34; will do the trick) in a cup of water. This is mostly to get the grease and sweat and everything off your fingers, but there's another purpose as well. You dip your fingers in the solution, then dip the protector in the solution...and shake off as much of the solution as you can. Really, it's not supposed to be dripping wet when you put it on your electronic device. There should *just barely* be enough of the soap-and-water solution to form a thin layer between the screen and the protector so you can move it around to just the perfect position on the screen. Now push the excess water out with the squeegee and VOILA! you've got a perfectly-positioned screen protector.<br /><br />Also, I know the manufacturer says to give it a couple days for all the bubbles to disappear and become fully clear...mine took about half an hour. Honestly, half an hour later it was so clear I thought it might have fallen off! I had to use a magnifying glass and look very closely to make sure I could see the edge of the protector.<br /><br />This protector covers the WHOLE screen of the Galaxy Gear Live (unlike another brand I tried first that left at least 1/8&#34; all the way around that wasn't covered, and would get caught on things and peeled up...so I used all three in the pack I got from them in less than two months).<br /><br />There is one drawback, but it is not specific to this product. Clear screen protectors get fingerprint smudges every time you touch them. It's just the nature of the beast.<br /><br />I've had this on my Gear Live for a couple weeks now, and I've not had a single problem with it. No edges catching, no peeling, no discoloration. If anything changes, I'll update the review, but for now, I recommend this screen protector without any reservations.he review, but for now, I recommend this screen protector without any reservations.\n",

            "I shopped many watches before I decided on this Timex model.  I've been wearing Timex watches for the last several years and have found them to be reliable and reasonably priced, so I was pretty much set on buying a Timex.  I have one of their Weekender models with a couple of different straps, which I alternate depending on what I'm wearing, and I really like it.  I also had a dressy model with the same easy-to-read dial that had an expansion band, and it died on me after several years, so I bought this watch as a replacement.  The watch works fine, and I like the easy-to-read dial and also the fact that it has the Indiglo light.  Plus, the watch is attractive.  I was disappointed, however, in the band.  The expansion band on my old watch fit perfectly, and the edges of the band were nicely rounded and smooth so that it was very easy and comfortable to put on and take off.  However, the band on this new watch seems a little bit smaller, so it tends to pinch a bit.  Also, the edges are sharper, which makes the watch rather uncomfortable to put on and remove.  This was a let down.  I don't know if these differences are due to a decline in quality control, an effort to reduce costs, or what.  I considered returning the watch and buying a different model, but since there wasn't actually anything wrong with the watch, I knew I'd have to pay return shipping, and I didn't want to invest that extra money.  So I kept the watch.  But I'm not entirely happy with it, solely because of the band.  Of course, that's the problem with shopping online--you can't try it on before you buy.  If you have a thin wrist, this band may be fine for you, but if you have an average or larger wrist, you may likewise be dissatisfied.\n",
            "I love the look of this watch - a big chunky silver face and band. Really cool. My issue is that the second hand keeps stopping so the watch doesn't keep accurate time. I have to re-set it each day. If it worked correctly this would be a five-star watch!\n",
            "Face color a bit brassy for my taste.\n",
            "Doing the job so far.  I bought it for my 13 y.o. who runs XC and track.  It's a little big for him but the functionality is great.\n",

            "The watch band showed up exactly as described. It looks great. My only critique is that the strap is a little long. I folded it over the same as I used to do for a synthetic watch band I used before and you can see the lighter underside of the part I folded over.\n",

            "So far .. so good.  (Yes, I read all the negative reviews on the web about Invicta watches and the Invicta company in general, which, if you believe the reviews, it sounds like the IRS has better customer service skills).<br />I liked the look of this watch and expect to use it as a 'heavy duty' time piece to spare my various Rolex's the wear & tear of everyday use.  A couple of immediate observations  ... (i) the manual pretty much sucks, you would do better to check the video's on YouTube for setting and calibrating the Pro-Diver Chronographs, and (ii) as an experienced SCUBA Instructor, I would be leery using this watch in anything deeper than a bucket of water, let alone 300 feet. The model I purchased does not have a 'screw-down' crown - although some other models in the 'Pro Diver Collection do - so I have a hard time believing this is water resistant at any depth.<br /><br />I'll update later if anything fails or fall-off.\n",

The strap aesthetically is unique and was my favorite part originally, but clearly quality was lost. Love the face of this watch tho. Price/Compliment ratio well worth the investment.\n",
            "ENORMOUS watch.  I have big hands and arms but this is HUGE.  I is a nice looking watch, very solid and comfortable to wear but its not a daily watch unless you take it off every night.  The band is solid, the bezel and case are sharp and well made.\n",

            "BUREI is offering a surprisingly good looking, high quality watch, at a price that seems too low. I can say this because I've purchased a dozen watches in the past few years and, I believe that only one was under $200.<br /><br />I'm showing you my pictures just so that you know that this isn't any bait and switch, the rose gold accents on the dial and around it, look like rose gold and the calfskin band looks good also.<br /><br />You'll also notice that the size is on the large side of  average for today's dress watches. I mainly wear dress watches every day, like the Citizen Eco-Drive that you see, and switch to flashier dress watches at times. This Burei watch fits right in with my others that were more than twice the price and you'll also see that it comes ready to be a gift.<br /><br />The stem has the two stop pull for setting the date and then the time. The band is really pretty nice and seems to be the normal 8.5 inch length, that will fit an 8 inch wrist and still allow you to tuck the end of the band in. This says that it's using a sapphire crystal, and that means better scratch resistance and it somewhat reduces reflection also, making this watch easy to read.<br /><br />The case is on the thinner side of average and I really look for this in my watches. I'm not the type who wears a giant sized, flopping, loose watch and this is not that style. It's sleeker and less trouble when wearing long sleeves, and I don't bang it against doorjambs when walking through a doorway either.<br /><br />It's plenty water resistant, and of course you'll want to protect the band more than the watch, I shower with my metal banded watches rated like this one is all the time.<br /><br />Now I've only been wearing this watch about a week, but today I can not only recommend it, but if this is what you were looking for, I could dare you to try and find a better deal. This is flat out a nice watch.<br /><br />It's 8/23/15, and if I forget to update, leave me a comment, and I'll tell you how it's doing in 6 months or a year. I'm talking about wear, because I'll surely be back if it quits working.<br /><br />Product sent to me for testing and evaluation.ell you how it's doing in 6 months or a year.

The strap is a substantial material and it loops through the watch, so I think these can be interchangeable. The colors are exactly as shown in the picture and the face even lights up. I think it's a great purchase for the price and people compliment it every time I wear it. Will be buying more of these.\n",
            "Watch looks good, seems to keep accurate time so far, and was reasonably priced.  My husband is happy for the most part with this replacement for his old Timex that died, but wished that he had had a choice of color on the band as he prefers black.\n",

            "Okay, so full disclaimer: I didn't buy this through Amazon, and when it arrived, one of the three I ordered appeared to have been previously opened, and didn't work, so consider this review accordingly.<br /><br />First let me say that, as you probably can already tell, the MSRP on this watch is hilariously inflated, part of the oldest marketing trick in the book to make you think you're getting value on a sale price. I seriously doubt anyone's ever bought one for the &#34;full&#34; price, and even the &#34;sale&#34; prices should be considered suspicious. I paid roughly 10% of the MSRP through an online clearinghouse, and all things considered I believe that it was an okay deal given the price I paid. I bought a total of three watches from Heritor, paying in the $120-$170 range (marked, allegedly, &#34;80-90% off&#34; their respective fake prices), and while one arrived broken, the other two, so far, seem to have been decent buys for the money. Mechanical watches aren't cheap, and Automatic Skeleton watches even less so. There is very little middle ground between worthless crackerjack box plastic knockoffs, and a Rolex that costs more than a used car and you put in your will. Obviously, you're not looking at this watch if you can afford to drop several grand on a Rolex, so be that as it may, this may be a watch worth considering for you.<br /><br />The movement is a fairly standard inline lever escapement from China (although Heritor claims that the movement from at least SOME of their watches comes from Japan), and so far (having worn one for a few days) seems reasonably reliable and accurate. Heritor's website provides more specific mechanical details of each model, but you really can't trace the movement to any particular make of any particular notoriety. The Day of Week and Day of Month complications (in the watches that have them) appear to legitimately function, although the Month indicator is manually advanced at best. The Automatic winding wheel works as advertised as well. The watch face does have a quality look to it, although some of Heritor's designs and colorations can be gaudy or difficult to read. The leather watch bands they come with are garbage, but replaceable--while they do appear to use genuine leather on the outside, the layer is thin, and thickness is given by a middle layer of foam. This makes it brittle enough to not withstand years or even months of buckling and unbuckling. If you like the band, wear it until it breaks, then replace it, otherwise just replace it right away with a metal band. I would not expect this watch to be durable. Don't wear it in the shower, or drop it, or wear it while working on things where you might be banging it up against things. If you think you can take good care of it though, and you enjoy wearing and looking at a mechanical skeleton watch, you may get your money's worth at least... but seeing as how you can't afford a Rolex now, I wouldn't expect you'll be able to afford one when this wears out or breaks, either.<br /><br />Personally of the three I bought, I like the aesthetic of the Lennon the most. It's rather thick and bulky, but classy looking and easy to read.vertised as well.

They're sturdy, colorful, easy to use, and they manage to be on the larger side without making me look goofy (I'm a pretty slim girl with small wrists) which i like. I'm a gymnastics coach and I use the stopwatch all of the time at work and I love how big the numbers are. It stands up to the chalk dust and abuse it gets while I set up equipment (I've given them a few good smacks against metal and there have been definite screen scratches but nothing to damage the functionality of the watch.) I use and abuse my sport watches and these stand up well. To the people with smaller wrists, I use the second to last hole on the strap because my wrists are tiny but it looks fine and the strap doesn't stick up like some tend to do. Two thumbs up\n",

I've got a different 50mm but it seems too big because it's so much thicker than this watch.<br /><br />Band is nice and flexible, not stiff. And, why did no one ever think of their little trick to keep the loop that holds the excess band in place before? What a great idea: Put a tab on the end of the band and a notch in the loop and they stay together. Brilliant!<br /><br />Chrono seems good although I haven't found out if there is a lap timer function. Not a big deal for me because I like chronos simply because they LOOK better. I rarely use the function.<br /><br />Totally preference but I like the white numbers in this model over the darker numbers models.

Mechanical = automatic or hand-winding watches are definitely the best way to go. If you have several automatics, buy a cheap watch-winder on Amazon, or wherever. Just make sure the small motor that rotates your watches is quiet! I got a brilliant 8 watch winder with storage for 8 more for $240. Great convenience, as well as good display. I also prefer leather bands and deployment clasps, which this model has. They can be expanded or tightened easily, according to the weather and ones usage, and they don't scratch as link bracelets do. They are also readily replaced when worn out, or when you just want a change. I have one question about this watch though; The sub-dial for the seconds can't be stopped when setting the watch time, hence even if your hours/minutes are accurate, the seconds are out, albeit slightly. usually pulling out the crown stops the seconds too. Unless I've missed something, or mine has a fault, you can't do this on this watch,as they keep right on ticking away. A small but noticeable design/movement fault I think.\n",

I was astounded on the first night of wearing it just how bright and clear it was. A very good feature is that the twelve position is red and very clearly so. Consequently there is no chance of ambiguity in reading the hour. I set the time to the IPad clock when I got delivery and in three weeks it has lost one second, if that. I've been owner of several watches as I like to vary it in the way women vary jewellery. This watch has not left my wrist since purchase nor will it. Shower, swim, dive, whatever. I don't think I'll go down to 200 metres, but I could. Recommendation? Most definitely. I'm thrilled with it.\n",

I personally like the Danish style minimal design and I still get complimented on it from people for the chambray. The face is a bit thicker than the Skagen watches I usually wear, so I sometimes catch it on doorways being careless in my small apt, but the glass and metal frame have held up well despite my efforts.

            "It looks great. Not sure why they call it a casual watch. It looks like a dress watch.<br /><br />My only major complaint is that the metal clasp sticks into the skin quite a bit. After wearing it for a while, it would hurt and it left a deep impression in my arm.<br /><br />The background texture is dramatic in the product photo but typically invisible in normal lighting.<br /><br />The date window is small but no smaller than my other watch.<br /><br />Only the hands glow in the dark, and even then, they are barely visible in pitch black. Don't buy this if you need to see it in the dark.<br /><br />Does NOT make any kind of ticking noise. Completely silent.<br /><br />The band smells like leather and is stamped with &#34;genuine leather&#34;.<br /><br />The glass is called &#34;sapphire&#34; glass, which I guess is scratch resistant. I've only had this for a week but no scratches so far. My Casio with &#34;mineral crystal&#34; has some deep visible scratches. I'm not sure if mineral crystal is the same as sapphire glass.\n",

            "I really wanted a watch with an hourly chime (to remind me to stand up and stretch at least every hour!), and tried this one even though the description does not state that it has this function. In fact, this watch actually DOES have an hourly chime (that you can turn on and off), even though it's not stated as such. Here are directions in case it's useful to someone else:<br />  -Press & hold the &#34;set/recall&#34; button when you're in time mode.<br />  -Press &#34;mode&#34; button repeatedly until you get to the &#34;chime on/off&#34; screen.<br />  -Press &#34;start/split&#34; or &#34;stop/reset&#34; button to toggle between on/off.<br />  -Press &#34;set/recall&#34; (done) to exit.<br /><br />I love everything about this watch, particularly the slim watchband, and the clever way the strap loop grabs the band and prevents sliding. Would absolutely buy again!\n",

            "Great-looking watch. Nice quality. Love the eco drive because I hate changing watch batteries. My main pet peeve is that the luminescence is lacking. Very hard to see the dial or the numbers when I wake up in the middle of the night compared to my two other eco drives. They really should fix that issue because it does detract from the quality of the watch. If not for that issue, I would have given five stars.\n",
            "Japanese built Seikos are always good value for the money and generally keep better time than their Swiss counterparts. I have a 15 year old 7S26 which is still ticking and keeping reasonable time A  8 year old Seiko 23 jewel Superior not built in Japan not good quality. A 12 year old Vostok 2416B which keeps better time than my Rolex.The true test is that of time.\n",
            "My wife loves it.  A few years ago, as a gift, I gave her a Seiko solar watch.  It died.  It was very tiny, and had few features.  It was very fussy. I bought this Casio as a replacement.  It is a real, tough watch, but it is also extremely elegant.  A great watch that is styled for a woman.  However, it is still very high tech, not just a piece of &#34;glam.&#34;  It is a &#34;set it, and forget it&#34; watch:  Solar charging, automatic, satellite atomic clock.  A lot of stuff is packed into this little watch.  I've had a men's Casio solar/satellite watch for over five years.  I have never re-set it.  Both watches reset at midnight, automatically, to the exact second.  Casio should sell this watch in the US!<br />A great woman's watch and it is totally maintenance free.\n",

            "This is fine automatic watch in the mid-range price bracket circa $2,500. It's lovely to look at and easy to read. It won't suit everyone as the Pink or Rose Gold toned case is really more 'orange' to my eye, but the gold is plated, not sprayed on!. The calibre that drives the watch is a 'manufactured' or in-house calibre. Only 1888 of them were made. FC watches are underrated by aficionados, but they offer something unique, and with quality to those who buy them. I think, over the years, they'll hold their value, or at least not depreciate as munch as some other more expensive brands.The roman numerals are printed as far as I can tell, not applied by hand, which is a small shame. The date dial is easy to read, and the dial face has some interesting patterned work which makes it interesting. Needless to say, the crystal, front and back, is sapphire, man-made of course, like all the other brands and like the Jewels in modern watches, unless you're super rich and can afford real jewels of course!. A good quality watch with its own FC calibre.\n",
            "I first noticed the Ice-Watch as it was worn by an  French Olympic women's saber fencer, and I thought it was cool. When we were in France for vacation in July, 2015, I noticed the Ice Watches in the jewelry stores.  Upon returning to Pennsylvania, I noted that my local stores did not sell this brand of watch.  I was pleased to be able to find one at a reasonable price.  I now have a good, stylish watch.  It is good to have a young style rather than always wearing a stodgy watch.\n",

The dial diameter is not too big, but I found it a bit daunting because of its thickness. I would find it difficult to wear it comfortably to the office or a party with a long sleeved shirt buttoned down. Since I was looking for a more dual purpose watch,  I returned it.\n",

I received a replacement watch for a faulty band on one. I received credit for one that wouldn't function after two months. The final defective one, I never heard back the seller. The fourth one is still functioning, but I am skeptical as to how long it will last given the makes track record with my experience. All I wished for was to add a few inexpensive watches to my wardrobe for tasks that I didn't want to wear my higher end watches for.<br />Bottom line, you get what you pay for.

I had the time and date set within 5 minutes...it was a bit tricky with the &#34;hold for two seconds then release and hold another second&#34;. I would give it 4 or 5 stars if I had been sent the right color, though!! That was was a huge disappointment, it said pink in the description and showed a pink watch but they sent me the blue version. It arrived the day of my daughter's birthday and I didn't want her to not have a gift to open, so I wrapped it and told her after that I could send it back and get the pink (she specifically asked for a pink watch) but she was was so eager to have a watch and wear it that she kept the blue. I know the day will come, though, that she'll start talking about how she actually wanted a pink one.\n",

I was not good at installing the band, so I took it to a jewelry shop at my local mall and they said they would install it for free... I just had to give my attention to the sales person showing me stuff while the other guy installed my band.<br /><br />Bottom line. This band looks better than the standard leather and feels better.\n",

The gold is a right, bright gold and stands out very well against the black metal. I have had many, many people ask me so far where to get this watch from.  It has a nice movement, very easy to adjust the size yourself with tools found at home.  The face is approx 1.75&#34;.  The tachymetre doesn't move on the face of the watch, either.  All-in-all I would buy this again. It has numbers at the outer edge of the watch while towards the middle of the watch it has roman numerals that can be seen through the peekaboo minute and hour hands, a really brilliant idea by them.  On the left there is a minute countdown 5, 10, 15 etc....that doesn't have a hand but looks really cool and doesn't seem like it's out of place.  the gold against the black is really very stunning.\n",

To my suprise the band is also made a a very sturdy material as well.

Even the box that it came in is a work of art. The winder pull is blue on the end. It has two settings. The first setting allows you to set the date and the second setting allows you to set the  time. The watch's description is unisex however I believe this is more made for a female's wrist. I cannot say enough good things about this watch and I would definitely order it again.\n",

First the watch received is not identical to the one in the picture, as many other said it doesn't contain th Bulova logo in the 12'clock spot, I got this as a present (it was bought on Amazon) but I didn't realize until recently this was the case...if I knew I would have returned it and complained about false advertising. I've always felt that this watch was subpar to others bulova's I own, it is too light, gives the impression that the inside is all plastic...the look and feel is not of a 130 dollar watch, you are much better getting other bulova models, a seiko or a citizen. In all honest though, it is an accurate watch, the strap is real leather, the weekday and date counters work ok, I didn't have any problems with watch itself. I just feel bad that the person that gave me this watch invested this much money on a product that is misleadingly advertised and in a watch that doesnt deliver the look and feel that others in this price range would.\n",

My wrists on right on the cusp, so I'll probably just wear it a little tighter than I prefer... not worth the trouble of sending it back.  It's a pretty watch and is as shown.  The little sparkle around the face is subtle and not too much.  Looks like of sporty, but also sophisticated.  Overall, nice watch, good quality.\n",
            "Better quality than I expected. Heavy duty rubber & metal. I expected some plaatic!  I think my son will love it.  The red light is cool. Haven't figured out the setting yet but I only tried for a minute. Lol.\n",

The transaction went smoothly and arrived on time.<br /><br />Note -<br />It seems to me that the manual that arrived with the watch does not cover all the functions. I went to the Invicta web site and the same instructions were online. After poking around for a few minutes I found a different model had better instructions.  Hence four stars instead of five.\n",

I needed to find a watch I could wear with my white scrubs I wear as a uniform and purchase something I wasn't going to be too attached too if I ruined while working. I have super small wrists and was worried that it would be too big, but luckily I was able to wear it on the second to last facet. The watch strap comes with 11 facet holes so it really does fit most people. This watch really offers the style and function I was looking for. I love it!!\n",
            "A must have. Very stylish. For all occasions.\n",
            "While the end links may not line up absolutely perfectly (which is a common problem with most aftermarket bracelets) the braclet is solid, heavy, and exudes quality. The braclet perfectly mirrors the SKX, a practical buy which will exceed expectations. My SKX007 was meant to be my work beater. After I put this bracelet on I instantly fell in love with the piece and treat like kin. Also it's nice to know a replacement bracelet is less than $70 and a few clicks away.\n",
            "This item was not worth the price, even at the daily value.  The band was thin and when bent, left an indention that wouldn't go away.  I ended up returning this item - not worth the money.\n",
            "Just got this, returning it. Too dark to see, I Shouldnt have to turn my wrist a certain angle to tell the time!\n",
            "well at first it a great looking watch out of the box weight was good movement was good it had some glitchy stuff like 40 day month and 7 week subdial. but for 30 bucks not bad, untill it stoped working after 2 hours movement was working but hands would get stuck and had to pull out crown and move them 2 hrs later same again so will be returning watch.\n",
            "I bought this watch Nov, 2014, wore it a couple of times. By Jan 2015 the watch had developed a mind of its own. It would work sporadically and not show an accurate time. Buyers please beware. Looks like a good watch but it really isn't. Upon close examination you can notice the flaws.<br />When I peeled the sticker from the back of the watch, I noticed the plate or emblem inside the watch was half painted/coated and had jagged edges.<br />Watch looks decent; but the quality is suspect and a far cry. Not worth more than a $20 watch.<br />Returning the watch under warranty would set you back a $20 shipping and handling fee. Not worth it for the price paid, it is absolutely worthless. Rather put it in the trash.<br />Pales in comparison to the other watches I own in the same price range. It is an absolute rip off. Stay away and spend your money wisely.\n",
            "The watch was fine if you were a young boy.  It is stated to be a man's watch.  It is fairly small. Over all was ok.  Just the time it took to.get it was long.\n",
            "My family loves Full Metal Alchemist. Both of my boys are fans. So this pocket watch set is a perfect gift item. This actually is two watches and my little guy is so excited to have his own Elric brother watch he screamed. They did an amazing job paying attention to the detail in these watches. All the way down to the remember engraving inside. These are well crafted. They are lightweight and not made of materials that will makes these watches heirlooms but they will hold up to daily use and last forever if only taken out for cosplaying. My oldest has now decided he shall be Edward Elric for Comic Con. This is a great start towards crafting his costume.<br /><br />As watches, these keep time well. They came with batteries installed and the time is easy to set. I have been checking them all week and they do not drop time at all. You really cannot beat the price either.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.\n",
            "This watch is a beautiful time piece, however mine arrived with the crowns threads stripped. I couldn't tighten down the crown. The watch arrived with the crown out. Poor Q.C. !  I've had to return this watch and order another one. Two stars due to aggravation.\n",

            "So simple. So functional. So reasonable.\n",
            "The primary problem is the integrated black strap.  On my wTch, it broke from wear with no way to replace it because its integrated into the watch face.  This watch, like most digital watches, keeps reasonable time, but with a broken unrepairable strap is now useless as a watch to wear on my wrist.  Needless to say that I'm very disappointed and now very leary about these single construction resin watches.<br /><br />I should also add that I've owned this watch for less than 2 years and have not worn it playing anything more agressive than golf.\n",
            "Ordered mine some time ago and it still is running strong. I loved that it came set to the correct time I didn't even have to set it. One issue is glass cracked on the first day.\n",

            "Received right away and watch is as described. Very pretty! Love it!!\n",

            "Looking to buy a decent watchband spring removal tool, I took a chance on the comparatively rather expensive Bergeon (based on previous good reviews).  Examining the business ends of this tool with a 10X loupe, all concerns regarding its cost vanished.  A genuine pleasure to behold and use such a beautiful and solid precision tool.  A quick search then of other tools by Bergeon led me to this set of their watchmakers screwdrivers.  Also wicked expensive.  But there simply cannot be better miniature screwdrivers than these.  Another example of superlative precision Swiss-made tools and instruments whose quality is unmatched anywhere on the planet  (I'm thinking here also of Sinar view cameras, the Rolex GMT, and the Hämmerli 208,—Olympic world champion .22LR sport pistol).\n",

            "After receiving the LAD German watch yesterday. There was no indication of longevity of the battery. The face of the watch is nice. Good for spot checking time. Unfortunately when the battery finally goes through its life span, I for one do not have the time to look for a jewelry store to replace the battery but other than that it is a very attractive watch. For temporary use but not for an operator.\n",

            "[[VIDEOID:9f12260f8b8bb920e91a8e4f1c9c5f51]] I received a sample for evaluation. All opinions are my own.      This watch is large, with approximately a 2\\\\\" face including the tip of the crown measuring to the outside of the bezel. It approximately measures 8 1/2\\\\\" inside the band. The watch is actually loose on my husband's wrists and he measures 7 1/2\\\\\" around. However, the link size is adjustable. There are 3 links on each side of the face that can be removed. Each link is approximately 12mm. I feel like I have \\\\\"large\\\\\" wrists as a woman, yet I can slide the links over my wrists without undoing the clasp. Two small flathead screwdrivers came with the watch and box set to customize the watch to a shorter length. The color of the Rosewood and ebony is deep and I think looks true as pictured. The grain of the wood is smooth on the links with a satin sheen, but the crown (the knob) on the watch has a rough finish compared to the rest of the watch. Overall, the watch is light and attractive. When the hands tick, you hear the movement. I personally did not care 100% for the sheen of the links though. I did like many other features of the watch though. I like hearing the hands on the watch tick, and that the hands on the watch are also glow-in-the-dark.    The date can be adjusted by pulling out the crown very lightly with the first pull, and turning the crown clockwise. The time can be adjusted by pulling the crown once more and can be turned in either direction.    The watch does come with a basic cardboard box and pillow to store it in or for gift giving.    UPDATED: 8/24/15.      I removed 2 links to shorten the band for my husband. There are no instructions included to do so. It's a bit tricky if you don't have steady hands.    Here is how I did it:      Two flathead screwdrivers are supposed to be included for link removal.    1) Take one flathead and insert it into the pin. I tried the pin closest to face first on the opposite side of the crown.    2) Hold one flathead screwdriver firmly in place while unscrewing the pin on the other side. If you don't see the pin loosening, then try switching sides.    3) Pull out the pin with tweezers or a needle nose plyer. Be careful of the finish. I just used my nails to remove it. The pin and screw is really small. So, I placed them in a dish while I adjust the links.    4) Fit the links back together and reinsert the pin and tighten the screw back on the other side using the same method as number 2.    I hope that helps, and makes sense. If not, I don't mind helping if you have any questions.\n",
            "Thank you\n",
            "Very pretty watch, even prettier in person! And a great price! It's heavy-ish as others have mentioned, but not in a bad way. You can tell that it's quality. Also the picture makes it look huge, but it's actually a very nice size. It doesn't look too large or masculine in any way. I will have to have several links removed, but that isn't a big deal. I have to admit the deal was so great that I was worrying that it might be too good to be true, but the watch comes with a card of authenticity. I'm really happy with this purchase and the icing on the cake was that it arrived early!\n",
            "Wrist band color not what I expected.  Nice watch, though.\n",

            "One of my favorite watches. The case and bezel are made from plastic which I wasn't expecting. Its is however perfect in size, lightweight and looks great. Put on a 22mm nato strap and now its my favorite to wear.\n",
            "The photo of the watch made the watch face look much bigger. I was surprised at the small size of the watch face. Also I had to buy a new battery to know if the watch even worked. Disappointed.\n",
            "It is nice but it won't fit 8 inch wrist.\n",
            "This is one heavy watch! Out of the box it weighs 7.7 oz. You definitely know you are wearing a watch when this on your wrist and other people will too----the watch face has a 2&#34; diameter.<br /><br />It is a beautiful watch and well designed. The hour and minute hands are easier to read and the date and timer dials are small, but easy to read. It is well constructed and very functional<br /><br />If I was judging the watch on just the watch, I would give it 4 stars.<br /><br />However, I received this watch for free and if I had paid for the watch I would be irritated by a couple of  things. First, this is a complicated watch and you buy it because it has a lot of functions. You would think the instruction manual would be helpful. It isn't. You don't get a model specific manual. You get a manual that contains instructions for various models of watches you need to figure out which one is yours and flip around to find it throughout the manual. If you are paying this much for a watch, you deserve your own manual.<br /><br />Also, the watch band is very large. Unless you have a very large wrist, you will need to remove a link or two and that will add cost to the watch. It would have been better if they would have included an extra link or two for people with very large wrists rather than making most people go to a jeweler to have link(s) taken out.<br /><br />So, these two factors knocked down my rating to three stars. If you want a nice big watch and the above two points don't bother you, then this would a good watch for you!\n",
            "You get exactly what was advertised.\n",

            "I live in San Francisco and love trying new eco-friendly things. This watch is beyond awesome (39$, really?). Cute, looks hipster/SF style, still feminine, not too big. Well, I'd definitely repurchase again if I has a time machine. :) Kudos to the maker!\n",
            "I've very recently got into watches and I have a few that are really nice, yet I must say that this one is my favorite. I love the look of the watch and the strap is very comfortable. I wear it very often and matches my kind of style perfectly!\n",
            "Love it!\n",
            "I've been wearing this watch or similar Casio watches for decades.  I expect the watch to last forever but for the band to break after a few years.  This time the watch itself broke where the pin that holds the band in attaches after only two months. It just fell off my hand one day.  It's of course a ridiculously cheap watch, but as a matter of principle I wanted it repaired (or more likely replaced) under warranty. First customer service insisted this was not covered by the warranty since it was the band.  I finally had to send a photo to a supervisor to show that it was the watch not the band just to get them to &#34;consider&#34; it.  Instead they said that based on the photo  &#34;it looked like this watch has taken a heavy impact due to external force(got pulled against something)&#34; so the best they could do was to replace it at the discounted price of $10 plus tax plus 8.95 S&H -- only $5 MORE than it cost me on Amazon.  They  succeeded in saving themselves the cost of a warranty replacement, but also in getting me to switch to Timex...\n",

I saw this one and thought the color was nice so I gave it a try.  The band is a good size and can fit those with larger wrists and smaller wrists (I wear mine on the very smallest setting).  The face of the watch is also smaller than what I expected which is nice because I was afraid of it looking clunky.  The numbers are very readable at a glance.  The lavender color is nice and the silver is very pretty as well.  Looking at the pictures I thought the silver was more of a frosted silver which I wasn't that attracted to but in the video it shows that it is not.<br />Overall a very attractive watch with nice features.\n",

I've been using these watches and their identically-priced cousins of similar design for years.<br /><br />In my experience, the battery lasts at least a year, often longer.  It is easy to replace.  For those who don't want the small trouble of battery replacement, a brand new MQ24 watch seems a reasonable alternative.\n",

It tells you how much energy is left stored in the capacitor by simply pressing the button at two o'clock and watching the second hand move forward by five to twenty seconds.  This gives you an approximate reading of how much kinetic energy is stored in the capacitor. Just a note the blue hands are nowhere near this vibrant in person. Inside they are almost black and outside in the sun they are dark blue. I think I'm going to get a dark navy blue leather band to put on this. Some have said this model is too thick and too big at 13 and 42 mm respectively but the window on the back that bubbles out fits comfortably in between my wrist bones and doesn't stick up too much. Overall it's a great looking watch that I would recommend.\n",

These are hard to find now-a-days, and so it makes it very unique.<br /><br />The style is very nice, setting/adjusting the time is easy to do. Winding up takes a little getting used to, and I'm still trying to figure out how long the watch will run before it's critical to wind up again.<br /><br />So far I have noticed that it does run a tad slow, about 5 min in 24 hours. that's not too bad, but in a week's time, that's a half hour off. Pretty serious if you're a punctual person. Thus the 3 stars.<br /><br />I'm going to keep watching it and comparing it to the actual time, and see how it does over time. I'll update my review as I learn more.<br /><br />A free sample was provided in exchange for an unbiased review.<br /><br />Update 08/24/15:<br /><br />I fully wound the watch at 8am yesterday and let it go to see how long it will last on one winding. The watch completely stopped at 12:10pm today. So almost 28 hours. I'll keep checking it to see if it's consistent. On the flip side, the watch seemed to keep better time this time around, maybe it just needed to be used? I'll keep tabs on it and post an update as appropriate.<br /><br />Update 08/26/15:<br /><br />I decided to see what happens if I wind the watch every 12 hours, rather than 24+. So far, the watch keeps consistent time. I think the trick here might be to wind itKU6WN6HH twice a day rather than once a day. Yes, more work in the long run, who wants to remember to wind their watch twice a day, but so far this seems to be a good solution to keeping time without electricity.\n",

Here  are ok but in the other winders  was defective 3  times and the watch can jump out from the house because the cheap plastic of its. I recommend this winder and want to know why has others brands  winders  prices of 200-1000$ .They have names but do same thing.  Don t be a snob and don t touch those super priced winders ,(only for snobs) . I forgot to say the price  of 59$ witch make the winder more atractive.NOW I BOUGHT THE SECOND WINDER SAME BRAND AND NO COMPLAINS,,\n",

            "I gave this watch as a gift. My BF loved it! The watch face is bigger which is very popular right now. This watch can easily be dressed up or down. I would gift this again as a gift.\n",

            "This watch is quite hard to see the digital dials. Other than that it has great functionality. Unless you're dead set on having white letters on black background for the digital display, I would recommend you go with a different model. I purchased this watch and the M100F to compare the two. I chose the M100F due to being able to read it.<br /><br />The other variants, while easier to see, are still difficult. I can read the digital dials at night if I stick my finger over the glass, letting the light reflect off my finger so I can read the digital dials. This trick didn't work on this watch though as the digital dials were still too dark.\n",

The size is a classic style and a comfortable one to be honest .I find myself wearing this over the fossils and the G shock more often than not (except at work). I'm far from an expert but I know what I like and like my Seiko 5 . for my next  purchase I'm thinking a 40 mm seiko5 j1 of some sort. I'll keep this updated if need be .peace\n",

            "i got this watch as a b-day gift from my fiance and i am completely satisfied. i love the feel and the look of the watch when i wear it. the watch keeps perfect time and usually once a day i wind it. it has a nice weight to it and i get complimented over the watch nearly every time i've been out with it on. the double pins holding the strap onto the watch is extra security and just adds a feel of integrity to the watch design. i get a very clear display at night with the tritnite night glow trademark invicta has. this is my 2nd invicta watch and i plan to start collecting more now that i see first hand how well designed these watches are and importantly comfortable. -\n",
            "I like the look of the watch. Found the clear back of the watch a little strange. My only concern is it may need to be worn every day. I pitched the watch mainly as a day time work watch.  During my last three day weekend I did not wear it. When I put it on for work I observed it had stopped two day prior and needed to be reset. To early to tell how accurate it keeps time. So far I have had to adjust it once. If I worked night shift I think I would go with a tritium watch but for day this watch seems to be a good choice.    UPDATE.  I have now been wearing the watch for several month.  The watch has begun to stop while being worn.\n",
            "Attractive looking online, and perhaps will be attractive to some people when they see it, but I found this watch to be made of cheap materials and had the appearance of such. I was excited to get it, but when I put it on I knew I couldn't wear it - this watch does not meet my standards for a quality accessory.\n",

            "The watch that I got was different from the photo.  It has dark metal and dark metal chain.  Also, it doesn't keep time well.  Sometimes, it is off by an hour within 24 hours, and other times, it is off only few seconds.  For the price, it is OK.\n",

            "I have had this watch for five years now and feel it's time to give my feedback on my companion. It arrived in May 2009 but when I opened the box I saw that it hadn't seen daylight since February the same year. The battery indicator still showed 'High' on the dial. The user-manual is comprehensive and you'll need it if you're not used to Casio watches. If you have used a Casio watch before then you'll have no problem operating this watch.<br /><br />I have used the Casio when travelling, doing heavy work and for trekking. I have used it in situations when I didn't want to risk my other watches, so the Casio has seen a lot of heavy use. I have never abused it but I have not been overly protective either, so it has experienced a very active life. It has never failed though and has been a very dependable companion. The case is very solid and the straps shows little wear after all these years. The watch has experienced temperatures from -25 deg Celcius to +40 deg Celcius and has been exposed to water, sand and dirt, all without a hitch.<br /><br />It syncs once a day and it usually does so without problems. I live in Norway and I'm at the outer range of the radio signal of the transmitter, but that has never caused any problems. I think I only have had to perform manual sync 4-5 times a year, and that is mostly down to me leaving the watch in a drawer in a concrete basement.<br /><br />The only negative thing about the watch is the alarm. The sound is very faint and the alarm-function is of no practical value to me. I guess that the solidity comes with a cost as the solid case is affecting the sound level. The world clock function is superb though if you are travelling.<br /><br />To me the Casio is a superb watch for its use. It has many useful functions and is very comfortable on the wrist. I would be really sorry if I somehow lost it tomorrow and would buy a new one in an instant if so happened.\n",
            "Excellent\n",
            "Didn't like it. It was way too big for me. I returned it and got a small one from the neon series. I've only had it for a day. It fits me better and so far I like it.\n",
            "Just beautiful.. fast shipping\n",
            "Awesome watch. Was a gift for my boyfriend. Unfortunately we broke up but that's not the watch's fault.\n",
            "Great, durable, very pleased as were grandkids.\n",
            "Good looking watch and keeps accurate time. Would have been 5 stars, but it does not have a screw-down as was advertised.\n",
            "I bought it a few years ago and didn't use it too much. It's VERY made cheaply. I recently plugged it in to use it and it doesn't work now. Into the garbage it went. Look elsewhere. Poorly made and doesn't last.\n",
            "I am only disappointed that I did get long ago\n",
            "Great value\n",
            "Looks classy and is totally quiet\n",
            "It was great while it lasted!  The 10 year battery lasted less than a year.  I was also not crazy about the rigamarole you had to go through to reset the time or a function.  Other than that, it's a really nice watch for about 20 bucks.\n",
            "after only a few minutes the clasp broke on both of the watches that I brought.\n",
            "Love it!\n",
            "The watch is pretty big on my wrist - bigger than I was expecting from the pictures. The sensors on mine works just fine but there is some silliness to it. This should be expected -&#62; The temperature reading is affected by body temperature, so to get an ambient temp reading you have to remove the watch and put it in the environment you want to measure for 20 to 30 minutes. Why not just pick up your smart phone an get the accurate local current weather and forecast. What about the barometer and altimeter -&#62; Well if you think of a hot air balloon you realize temperature has a huge impact on air density and on instruments that measure air density like a barometer or altimeter. (Barometric air pressure drops about 1 inch of mercury per 1000 feet of altitude as you go up in altitude. And temperature has a big affect on air density too, so in aviation there is a concept of density altitude where on hot days you compare the density of a hot day atmosphere (say 100 degrees F) to a standard atmosphere day (say 59 degrees F at sea level) and you see the air is less dense and you have to accelerate to a much faster speed to take off on a hot day. The acceleration to a faster speed uses up more runway length so you have to check if you have enough runway to takeoff at all.<br />So how does all this affect the watch -&#62; If you take the watch off your wrist where it was at a temp of ~83 degrees F and move it to an ambient temp environment with different temp it is also going to experience an air density change and think it has changed altitude and barometric pressure as well. So this is how I use my watch -&#62; I don't use it to measure temps - I just leave it on my wrist so I don't expose it to the air density changes it experiences off my wrist. Then I use it to see relative changes in barometric pressure and altitude. For the barometer I watch the trend - for centuries the barometer, all by itself, has been a break through weather predicting instrument. If I am a sailor and I see the baro take a pretty fast dip I know a storm is brewing and I need to respect that and take appropriate action, etc. For the altimeter, when I go bicycling, I like to see how much relative change (going up hill and down) I have made - I know (or look up) the MSL elevation of the places I start from, and I set the watch on my wrist to the start elevation. Now I can watch pretty good relative changes in elevation I achieve going up an down hill for me as a cyclist. I like the quick reference for the moon phase and the tides as well. Like my old Red-Rider BB gun I also enjoy the compass in the stock - it works and I actually use it.<br />The watch is tough - I was about half way through working under on my wife's car putting on a receiver hitch for a bike rack before I realized I still had my watch on and was banging it around on stuff under the car. It didn't get scratched or damaged but it is not a hammer.<br />The atomic time setting works well. We live in the SE in GA far away from WWVB in Colorado. The signal strength meter in the watch works well to find a place to put the watch where it can receive the weak WWVB signal and set itself to the Bureau of Standards atomic time keeping. Mine sets every night to WWVB, and its pretty neat to have dead nuts accurate time right on your wrist.<br />So in summary - I'm a geek, and - besides real accurate time of day - the watch gives good relative readings of baro trend, altitude, moon phase, tides, and compass and it's size and impressiveness compensates well for any other personal deficiencies I may have. I really enjoy the thing, but it you want quick or accurate data (other than time of day) - pickup your smart phone.ilor and I see the baro take a pretty fast dip I know a storm is brewing and I need to respect that and take appropriate action, etc. For the altimeter, when I go bicycling, I like to see how much relative change (going up hill and down) I have made - I know (or look up) the MSL elevation of the places I start from, and I set the watch on my wrist to the start elevation.

I pulled the battery out and my volt meter says the battery is fine. I put the watch back together and it works fine. For another two weeks. Cleary, their is a short within the watch.

Then as I got older, I imagined I could do with a little class, that is where watches (and even clocks) come in.<br /><br />Before reviewing this item, I took a look at the history of Anne Klein, fashion, products and watches...very interesting history.<br /><br />I am not familiar with many things fashion related as I follow my own tastes, and women's fashion...I am that much more clueless.  But I believe this watch, this model matches my wife's tastes quite well.  The Anne Klein AK/20521VST Crystal Accented Gold Tone and Ivory Bangle Watch and Bracelet Set is truly lovely...to say the entire name is a mouthful indeed but there is one, perhaps two components of the name and description that I believe my wife would find lovely.<br /><br />My wife likes sparkly things, she often has her attention drawn to things that have many jewels...singular is one thing...but many facets catch her eye.  She will love the arrangements of the Swarovski crystals.  The gold tone of the stainless steel is also something she will appreciate.  She, as well as I, am not a fan of the very yellow \\\\\"gold\\\\\" things that are made, we like it white gold or sterling silver...this has that gentle hue of the \\\\\"gold tone\\\\\" that she will find quite nice.  The ivory tones are also quite soothing and relaxing just to observe.  The enameling finishes off the set sublimely.<br /><br />On top of the aesthetics and the quality of craftsmanship, there is a built in touch of adjustment.  Both the watch bracelet, as well as the bracelet with the link design, are designed to allow you to remove a segment that appears to be 15mm in lenghth.  Of course, the way it's designed with the clasps on both ends of this adjustment link you would have to remove the other clasp, making the adjustment about a 20mm reduction?  I am not a jewelry expert but as I measured this I was wondering how much it would actually adjust, so I hope this helps.<br /><br />A lovely watch and bracelet set for your loved one.m reduction?

            "I did a lot of research before buying this watch.  I was torn - should I buy a watch with automatic movement or quartz?  Will the battery be a pain in the neck to replace?  Will this watch be large enough?  Those questions were put to rest through a combination of research online (apparently this watch model has a HUGE following among the dive-watch nerds -- and I intend that term NOT to be taken disparagingly).  After receiving the watch this week and wearing it for a few days, I believe I can confidently write this review and state this watch is an incredible bargain.<br /><br />It's a very handsome piece.  The case (size-wise) is larger than my Orient Mako, and is actually more in-line with a Seiko SNZF I used to own and black is always in style.  The bezel turns easily, but not so much that it's loose or will move accidentally.  The action allows for two-clicks per minute, 120-clicks for full rotation.  The photos do this watch justice - what you see is what you get.  The finish of this watch is quite nice - belying the $45-$50 price-tag.  I would expect this level of quality on a much more expensive time-piece.<br /><br />Quartz movement.  I was concerned I would hear this watch tick-tick-ticking away the time at night.  The movement is barely audible with the watch pressed to my ear.  Now my only concern is that of the battery, and I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.<br /><br />The strap - at first I was worried it was a little flimsy but as I have worn it this week, I misjudged the strap; it's fine.  It's soft enough, not too plasticky, and fits well.  The watch is very comfortable to wear.  I thought I would be replacing the strap but I think I'll keep it.<br /><br />The only negative aspect is that the luminescence is a bit on the dim side, but in a completely dark room, I can see the time and it lasts all night.  I woke up a few times and was easily able to see the time.  Some people complain that it's not as bright as a Seiko SKX007 or Orient Mako or Ray models, but then again - it's not a Seiko or Orient watch, and costs about 1/3 of the price of the Seiko and 1/2 the price of an Orient.  And here's a little secret I have yet to read/hear from any Seiko or Orient watch owners - Seiko's and Orient's luminescence seem to be very strong coming in from the sunshine or being under a light, but after a few minutes, they get dimmer too, and eventually (e.g., during the night when your kids wake you or you need a drink of water) the luminescence of the Seiko and Orient are on-par with this Casio.<br /><br />The crown - I have never owned a true dive watch before with screw-down crown.  It took a little getting-used to, and it's great because the screw-down action keeps me from messing with the time and trying to get it to be as &#34;right&#34; as possible.  The crown-guards are also appropriately sized and keep the crown from snagging on anything, which I appreciate since I have worn this to work with long-sleeved shirts.<br /><br />I'm definitely not a watch collector.  I HAD (past tense) a Seiko 5 SNZF-15 watch for about 18 months.  The lack of accuracy drove me NUTS.  I wore g-shock watches (which I have subsequently sold or passed on - digital is not my thing) and tried probably a half-dozen other styles before coming back to this simple design.  No alarms.  Water resistant.  Rugged.  Dependable.  Dual purpose - it looks good worn with casual clothes as well as business.\n",
            "A great basic watch. I love the simplicity of it.\n",
            "For the ridiculously low price this is a great weekend chore watch. I haven't had it long enough to opine on its durability. It's good looking, passes for a more expensive watch and the price is unbelievable. Oh, it also keeps good time so far.\n",
            "It was a gift for my husband, he thought it was fabulous\n",
            "Simple, attractive, very legible, go anywhere design is torpedoed by its bracelet and lug design.<br /><br />The watch is the right size (midsize) at 46mm and is a very good looking piece.  All the finishes are pleasant, with the satin, sand-blasted bracelet and case really drawing you in.  The dial is well marked and easy to read at a glance in strong or low light.  Water resistance rating of 200 meters, backed up by a screw-down crown makes it fully functional.  The clasp is a very cool spring-loaded butterfly that works beautifully.<br /><br />What's the rub?  First, it's sizing the thing.  There are no half-links or 2/3 links to mix and match with the full links, so your adjustment increments are about 4mm.  Lame.  Either you're cutting off your circulation or the thing is flopping around on your wrist like a bangle.  Ultra lame.  Then there's the absurd height of the lugs.  What looks like a flexible first link is actually rigid and part of the lugs.  It makes the lugs ridiculously tall and the watch even more uncomfortable.<br /><br />Had high hopes for this one.  Second Swiss Legend I've tried and the second total failure.  No more.  Interesting when you consider that they (SWI)also make Red Line; four of which I've purchased and enjoy regularly...\n",
            "Just what I wanted!\n",
            "Love this watch.\n",

            "I love I love and I love. No regrets at all\n",
            "Okay, so full disclaimer: I didn't buy this through Amazon, and when it arrived, it appeared to have been previously opened, and didn't work, so consider this review accordingly.<br /><br />First let me say that, as you probably can already tell, the MSRP on this watch is hilariously inflated, part of the oldest marketing trick in the book to make you think you're getting value on a sale price. I seriously doubt anyone's ever bought one for the &#34;full&#34; price, and even the &#34;sale&#34; prices should be considered suspicious. I paid roughly 10% of the MSRP through an online clearinghouse, and all things considered I believe that, had it worked when it arrived, it would have been an okay deal given the price I paid. I bought two other watches from Heritor in the $100-$150 range (marked, allegedly, &#34;80-90% off&#34;), and they both, so far, seem to have been decent buys for the money. Mechanical watches aren't cheap, and Automatic Skeleton watches even less so. There is very little middle ground between worthless crackerjack box plastic knockoffs, and a Rolex that costs more than a used car and you put in your will. Obviously, you're not looking at this watch if you can afford to drop several grand on a Rolex, so be that as it may, this may be a watch worth considering for you.<br /><br />The following is based off my experience with one of the other, similar model Heritor watches that arrived in working order, and may or may not be 100% accurate for this particular watch:<br /><br />The movement is a fairly standard inline lever escapement from China (although Heritor claims that the movement from at least SOME of their watches comes from Japan), and so far (having worn one for a few days) seems reasonably reliable and accurate. Heritor's website provides more specific mechanical details of each model, but you really can't trace the movement to any particular make of any particular notoriety. The Day of Week and Day of Month complications (in the watches that have them) appear to legitimately function, although the Month indicator is manually advanced at best. The Automatic winding wheel works as advertised as well. The watch face does have a quality look to it, although some of Heritor's designs and colorations can be gaudy or difficult to read. The leather watch bands they come with are garbage, but replaceable--while they do appear to use genuine leather on the outside, the layer is thin, and thickness is given by a middle layer of foam. This makes it brittle enough to not withstand years or even months of buckling and unbuckling. If you like the band, wear it until it breaks, then replace it, otherwise just replace it right away with a metal band. I would not expect this watch to be durable. Don't wear it in the shower, or drop it, or wear it while working on things where you might be banging it up against things. If you think you can take good care of it though, and you enjoy wearing and looking at a mechanical skeleton watch, you may get your money's worth at least... but seeing as how you can't afford a Rolex now, I wouldn't expect you'll be able to afford one when this wears out or breaks, either.\n",
            "The watch is a nice looking watch and fits my wrist well after removing three of the links.  My problem is primarily with the luminated dial.  It's terrible.  The hands do not illuminate and because the dial does, it is impossible to read the watch in dark conditions.  If you don't care about that, it's a nice watch.\n",

            "Already wrote a review. I love this watch!! Thanks\n",
            "The watch came today and it works perfectly. All the settings work and it is new out of the box. I have no problems with the watch. It is better to buy this watch on Amazon then the official G-Shock store or other stores because it is way cheaper than retail price! Almost a $60 bargain! Anyways, it is perfect and works perfectly. (May update if any problems occur. If no update, then it means I am still a happy person! :) )  P.S. For those of you who want to know, the watch came inside the original G-Shock case with an instruction packet and a warranty card. There is foam padding inside the case.\n",

I went on Amazon to see what I could find in my budget and was blown away when I found this $495 watch for less than $150!!!! And add to that, it was exactly everything I wanted in a watch. I love the white ceramic, the stainless steel with gold accents, the sparkly diamonds, the solar battery that will never have to be replaced, the size is stylish and not overly big, I could go on and on!!\n",

My only slight complaint is that the hands are a little difficult to read when not wearing my glasses in the water.  I wished they had more contrast.  Over all, I'm satisfied with this purchase.\n",

Overall, it's a great band.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because where the clasp is, it's a bit bulky.  But I knew that because I had read previous reviews.  If you want a good quality band that looks like it's going to last a long time, get this.

I mean for a large-face watch this should fit up to at least a 7&#34; wrist with room. I think they did not want to give you the extra links that you normally get when you buy watches because this is a cheap watch.  I usually remove links on all the watches I buy, but I buy high-end watches normally.  Also, it says 'Rubberized&#34; well my mistake was thinking that that meant that the band would be more 'silicone' and flexible. There is NOTHING flexible about this band at all.  It feels like you're wearing a matte ceramic band- it's a hard band, hard links. I LOVE the matte look of this- that is why I bought it and the large face is cool, and the rose trim but other than that... dislike. I just needed one more link in the bracelet and it would not be tight on my wrist.  I'm going to purchase a cheap silicone band and swap it out, perhaps a white band or something in a generic silicone cheap band.\n",

Secondly, the watch came with incomplete instructions. The fly-back chronograph was properly documented but there was no documentation available for the E6B slide rule functions (nothing available Timex's website either). Fortunately, I'm a pilot and already know how to use an E6B so at first the lack of instructions was not a deal-breaker for me.

            "I am very happy with this watch. It was working right out of the box… great it needs no battery! It is a bracelet  type of watch and is beautiful with all the bling around the crystal. I have a large wrist and it fit beautifully with even a little room to spare, so as not to be snug. If you do have a small or medium wrist you will most likely have to take it to a jeweler to have it sized down.\n",

            "I bought this watch as a gift to myself with my bonus check in 2013 and am still very satisfied with it. It has so far been a very durable watch that has gone with me into the wilderness of my home in Alaska to staying strapped on my wrist for weeks straight of backpacking through Portugal and Spain in 100 degree weather. You cannot ask for a more comfortable (and so far for two years durable) watch without going digital. Really wish I had this watch back when I was a scout.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />*The watch is a modest 40mm size making it comfortable for daily wear and lightweight since you the bezel is aluminum and the band is nylon.<br />*The face is very legible with white text on a green background and convenient date window at 4'clock and luminous hands, but note no luminous markers.<br />*The movement it runs on is pretty simple, one YouTube tutorial and you'll be a wiz at adjusting and using the chronograph. (Mine came with the chronograph hands resetting to the wrong positions everytime, so I watched a video and learned how simple it is to adjust the chronograph on the movement it uses so it reset properly.) Also it's a modern ETA movement so it can do elapsed time on the chronograph. This means that if you stop the chronograph with the reset pusher (bottom pusher) it stops the hands so you can view them, but it keeps the chronograph going in the background so if you hit the reset pusher again it will speed ahead from where you stopped it to where it is the second time you pressed it, this is very helpful for timing laps. Sure a digital stop watch records times and can list them for you, but that's the price you pay for being traditional and cool, a little bit of mental math. It's still a feature worth mentioning that not all movements incorporate.<br />*Can't really say much about its water resistance except it survives washing the dishes and salmon fishing, but I'll just assume it's good to 100m as that is pretty standard.<br /><br />The cons: (for meanyways)<br />*The chronograph operates wonderfully, but back when I purchased this watch it was advertised as having an hour chronograph dial, in the picture you can clearly see it has 1/10 of a second, realtime, and a 30min totalizer, but I wasn't smart enough at the time to notice that it was a 1/10 of a second dial and not an 10 hour dial (which I thought was pretty weird in the first place that it was 10 hours and not 12, but just figured it was a size thing since this isn't a ginormous watch). If you don't need hours on your chronograph then it's not even a con, but for me it was a bit of a con because I was expecting an hour dial (I had never heard of a 1/10th of a second dial before this watch, but I suppose I could see it's uses, stI'll wish it was an hour dial though) It works great, but if you want to time more than 30 mins you have to do mental math and pay attention to how many 30 minute segments have passed.<br />*The green paint on the bezel can get scratched off a little on the edge, but it's not a huge deal for me since this is my daily wear, utility watch for non-formal occasions.<br />*The lens isn't sapphire like some watches in the price range and most that are above, it's mineral crystal and can get scratched up a bit. The lens is strong and I have no doubt in its durability, it just shows scratches more than scratch resistant sapphire, again it's my utility watch so it's not a major let down.<br />*The band can suck sometimes if it gets wet since its cloth. It's nylon so it dries pretty quick, but it still gets absorbed and can be a little annoying. It's still worth it in my opinion though because I like the military look, it looks very similar to a standard green NATO watch band, only major difference being that the stainless steel buckle on the factory band has a neat Victorinox shield etched into it. Some people say the watch band is dinky, but mine has lasted two years of work and adventure. I'm a groundskeeper and a fisherman, so I frequently get my watch caught in nets at both jobs and it's never snapped, in fact the top pin that holds the band onto the case just came our undamaged. The pins appear to be spring-loaded and just pop back into place. Luckily the button pin stayed in otherwise I might have lost the watch. If the band concerns you I'd imagine at standard green NATO nylon band would fit fine this watch fine.<br />*The lumination on the hands doesn't last much longer than 30 mins, leading me to believe it's not aged tritium, but they still are very bright when they are freshly charged with natural or artificial light. Also the hands are polished stainless steel skeleton hands with large white ends, so it really isn't ever hard to read unless you're in complete darkness or have some serous cataracts.<br /><br />Overall this is a great no-nonsense, authentic, Swiss watch with just a few cons that are probably due to this watch being relatively affordable. If you don't need hours for your chronograph and want a comfortable watch that matches the cool green military jacket that you probably have because you saw the picture like me and thought the same thing, then this is the classic, rugged watch for you! (And yes it does match my army green jacket nicely.)\n",

            "My previous watch, another Tissot, lasted 20 years until it died a few weeks ago.  Perhaps I should have had it repaired.  This new watch is fine as a piece of jewellery (shiny, pretty) but not so good for telling the time.  The problem is it is very hard to read in many lighting conditions.  The hands are almost the same shade as the watch face and the watch face itself has a very strong reflection of light sources.  The end result is one has to peer at the watch to determine the time!  Not very practical.\n",
            "Bah ha  Timex sure dropped the ball here. the idego light stopped after about a month  I wore it until the band broke and them i got a Casio  which so far seems ok.\n",
            "Incredible value for $300~  Rivals watches costing 4x its value\n",
            "Superb watch, in every way.  Everything about the look of it oozes quality.  The finishes, polished in some places, brushed in others, are exquisite.  The bezel turns smoothly and ratchets positively.  The manual wind and hack functions work perfectly.  Mine is consistently 5-6 seconds fast per day, which is well within spec.  The lume (the glow in the dark hands and hour markers) is awesome!  This is a serious dive watch, but I'll admit that I'm not a diver, and don't intend to be.  I bought this watch for two reasons: I think it is the most readable-at-a-glance of any Seiko, and it has the 8L35 movement, borrowed from the much more expensive Grand Seiko line of watches.  It replaces a perfectly good Casio Mudman G-Shock digital watch, which I had been wearing for nearly 10 years.  That watch still works as well as it did 10 years ago, but my eyes don't.  For the last few years I've had to get out my reading glasses to read the time.  With this watch I can tell the time with or without my reading glasses, and in any light.  Are there any cons at all?  Well, the watch is quite heavy, as you'd expect a large, solid stainless steel watch (and band) to be.  Many people say that even as heavy as it is, with a little time &#34;it disappears on your wrist.&#34;  Yep, it does, until you move your wrist, and then you're instantly aware that you're swinging some weight around.  I don't find it unpleasant.  It's also fairly thick, at 15.3mm, and it looks downright chunky on your wrist.  Strangely, although it appears thicker than the Casio I replaced, it's actually almost 2mm thinner.  Must be the bright stainless vs. black rubber.<br /><br />Finally, and I almost hate to bring this up, there are unexpected intangibles that make me like this watch even more.  Pride of ownership?  Perhaps.  I like the feeling I get when I look at it and see the perfect fit and finish.  I love the second hand that steps 8 times a second, appearing to move very smoothly.  I love the clever bandextension built into the clasp, allowing you to quickly let out the band to fit over a wetsuit.  And of course, I love being able to read it, day or night, with our without my glasses.  It does exactly what I wanted, and looks far more elegant than I expected.  This is a fabulous watch.\n",

            "This is a pretty solid watch. Be warned, it's a pretty heavy watch. On a watch this size with a metal band, the band will sort of balance the weight on your wrist. This watch, with the nylon band, is heavy to one side because the band is so light. So, it always wants to spin around my wrist. I could probably stop this by wearing the watch a little tighter. This may not be a problem if you're used to big watches with nylon or leather bands. I haven't had a watch without a metal band for many years, so it's taking some adjustment on my part. For those of you with large wrists, the band is nice and long. I have about 9&#34; wrists,and I use the second hole on the band. I can get it to the 3rd hole, but then it's a little tighter than I prefer. The only other thing I wish this had is the date. I miss that on a daily basis. Those minor gripes aside, I really like this watch. The numbers/hands are easy to read. I use this watch as my daily wear watch for work. I've knocked it around a little bit, and it still isn't showing any scratches or dings. The only spot where there is any evidence of wear, is on the buckle and the bars that retain the tail of the band.\n",

The watch is heavy as noted by several other reviewers, but that being said, will only make it that much more sturdy if you choose this as an everyday watch.  It's blingy enough to be worn as a dressier watch yet is absolutely perfect for everyday wear too!! It's a phenomenal watch for the price. I paid well over what I spent on these 2 watches put together when I had purchased my diamond Bulova watch several years ago but sadly my Bulova has no where NEAR the durability of these watches!!!

If you prefer the jubilee I would recommend the aftermarket jubilee bracelet as the stock bracelet is too light and the appearance shows it.\n",

I just hate stuff on my body when I'm working out. So many features for such a little price. This is, by the way, my third Ironman Timex. The first two survived seven Ironman tris and numerous marathons. Great product. I just wish it was a bit more comfortable and somehow weighed less. But still...worthy of 5 stars and then some.

I work loss prevention and the watch continued to withstand abuse even after knocking it off brick walls and glass while fighting with shoplifters. I've gone swimming with it in the ocean, pool and shower and it still keeps trucking. I take it to the range and basically any athletic activity or dirty work I can count on it! This watch is outstanding the ruggadnesss of it! If your looking for a watch to take abuse like a champ. Buy this one!\n",
            "Ok, I did not get this watch on Amazon, but wish I did since the price was better.  This review is concerning the quality of the watch.<br /><br />When I bought this watch it was in a display case and not running, I wound it and checked the functions and 'rough' accuracy against my atomic watch for a few minutes before buying it.  The watch has a good heavy weight and durable genuine leather band which I LOVE.  My atomic watch is without a band because I got tried of replacing cheap resin bands.  I have another that has a stainless steel band which is more durable, but less comfortable.  Therefore, the soft but durable leather band was a big plus for me.  The Watch is rated at 50 m/ 165ft water resistance but I don't swim or shower with it.  It has gotten wet from sink faucet and rain without any issues.<br /><br />The only issue I have had with the watch was that after a hour i started noticing it was running a few seconds fast.  Of course, by the end of the day it would have gotten a lot further off.  I saw on another review here where a user was claiming the watch kept bad time too.  However, I'm guessing they didn't even consider that the watch may need recalibration.  So long as a mechanical watch is functioning and not broken or damaged, it should be able to keep very accurate time, this goes for any of them.  I removed the back cover and tapped the regulator lever very slightly counter-clockwise to slow it down and let it run for another hour.  It was then about a second slow.  I then lightly tapped the lever very very slightly clockwise and let it run for a few hours after syncing it again with my atomic watch.  After 3 hours it was still second-per-second in tune with my atomic watch so I re-installed the cover.  After this calibration the watch seems to loose about a second every other day, which is very good to me.  For those that don't want to go inside the watch and try calibrating it yourself, I believe most jewelery stores will do it for you.<br /><br/>** Tips for all mechanical watches **<br />Tip:  It's the balance wheel lever pointing towards the blue screw.  The other (larger) lever is the amplitude lever that regulates how 'much' of a swing the wheel goes through and should not be messed with.<br /><br />Tip until you calibrate:  If you know your watch is off roughly by a number of seconds, set the watch HALF that the other way in the morning and it will keep more accurate time throughout the day than if you set it exactly on time in the morning.<br /><br />For example:  Watch is 5 seconds fast over the day:  Set it approximately 2.5 seconds SLOW.  As the watch speeds up over the day it will approach being on time, then at the end of the day will be about 2.5 seconds fast roughly.<br />Conversely, if the watch is 5 seconds slow over the day:  Set it approximately 2.5 seconds FAST.  As the watch slows down over the day it will approach being on time, then at the end of the day will be about 2.5 seconds slow roughly.\n",

            "I have had this watch about two weeks.  I love it and would highly recommend its purchase. Its absoulte accuracy, large display, and cool appearance are  my reasons for the 5 stars. I have had no problem with the length of the strap (have an inch and half to spare). One of my best purchases of late. Of course time will tell if all this praise is warranted.  &#34;Handsome is as handsome does&#34;.\n",
            "Great watch for a great price. Get a lot of compliments when wearing this watch. Looks really sharp with any outfit but looks even better with my suit. Just make sure to wear daily since it's a movement watch. Glad I made this purchase.\n",
            "I bought this watch at here.<br />but it doesn't work.<br />Is it no battery inside or what happen?\n",
            "It works! It keeps time well, and I have gotten comments from my friends that watch anime that it looks really good and that they wanted one themselves. It has a lot of detail, up to the writing on the inside of the watch. However, the clasp holding the watch closed has a tendency to get stuck open. Also, the roman numeral 4 is written wrong (IIII instead of IV). Overall, I will need to make another purchase with this group again to see if all of their items has little oversights like this or mine was just five degrees off of great\n",

            "Just what I was looking for. Actually nicer looking than I expected. The blue and grey combination work well for casual to work. I've written it in the pool and no problems with water. Fits well on my wrist, band is comfortable.\n",
            "The white face and the white hands make it very confusing to tell time, the hand and face just blend together\n",
            "I love being able to replace my own pins in  my watch. This is so much better than paying $10 for each broken pin at the shop.\n",
            "It seems a bit small for my wrist. I have it only 1 hole left on the band. Also seems like it's missing a button. I mean you can do everything you need to do, but the light button on the upper left is a multi function button that also controls the stopwatch and could have been a separate button on the top right.\n",
            "Watch broke within 2 days. Also it couldn't even keep the time right.\n",

            "Within 12 hours of owning this product, the band broke which is a huge disappointment, for the price the band shouldn't be such poor quality\n",
            "The quality is seriously missing on this product. The lining that is connecting the glass to the velvet was already peeled back in places when I received it. The glass top slams shut way too easily (no weighted hinge). The bottom drawer does not slide in smoothly. Due to the friction of sliding the drawer, the black faux leather material disintegrates and cakes the top of my dresser with a fine black powdery substance. I am worried that this material from the poor construction will get on to the grey/cream colored interior and look terrible.<br /><br />Cheap cheap cheap.. you get what you pay for I guess.\n",
            "You never have to do anything with this watch after initial set-up. Keeps time within a second or two of official world time. Updates automatically while you sleep. Adjusting the wrist band on this watch is very tedious. There has got to be a better design for wrist band adjustment. Also, removing 3 links was just a little too tight, but removing 2 links left the band a little too loose.\n",
            "Great looking watch, stem is small bit workable.\n",

            "My boyfriend absolutely loved the watch. It looks great and exactly like the picture.\n",
            "Bought this watch for work since my fossil was to heavy. I have to say that this watch is light and and comfortable. The green color is the coolest thing about the watch. I was going to buy yellow or red color but glad that I bought green.\n",

            "Simple sleek and a great color. I only wish it had a date display but then that might have taken away from overall look so very happy with it. I have other Kenneth Cole watches and for the price they are extremely well designed and always reliable.\n",
            "This watch is awesome! I am a pre-nursing student and got this watch so I can use it at the hospital. It's got a 24 hour clock and has the date. It's waterproof and works very well, plus it's aesthetically pleasing. I took it with me while vacationing in Hawaii, swam with it several times in the salty Ocean and it still works! I love it!\n",

            "GREAT WATCH BAND. GREAT ADJUST ABILITY!!\n",
            "Purchased for my husband.  He likes it OK except has had difficulty with having the correct date come up.  The &#34;military time&#34; would be a big advantage for some people.  The face is easy to read and the band is comfortable for him.\n",

            "This watch is essentially a copy of a Casio watch in look, feel and functions. This is appropriate for little kids and juniors who just need a functional watch to tell time, have an alarm, have a light function for evenings, and a stopwatch for various activities including sports. The build quality is on par with the mid-end Casios, which I am very familiar with as even Casios are made in China these days (except the super high end ones). The silicone feels soft and everything about this watch feels very good. The only thing you don't get with this is a brand name recognition, but that could be a good thing for little kids.<br /><br />A sample was provided.\n",
            "Great look, really stands out\n",
            "I purchased this watch for an after Christmas gift. It is really solid and substantial, and with the Seiko movement, it should last for a long time.\n",
            "Amazing! Highly recommended. Nice, sleek design and beautiful feel to the silicone! Perfect for swimming and water-activities.\n",
            "Bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend to store all of his nice watches. He loves it! The carbon fiber pattern gives it a very upscale look.  Feels sturdy and the hinges don't creak when opening and closing. The storage compartments vary in size so it can fit multiple styles. Highly recommended.\n",
            "So far it's a good watch. I've only had it 2 days. Beautiful design for the money.<br /><br />2nd review: I've only worn it two times. Bottom button must be broken! Can not change the settings at all! Would love a refund but it states it's to late. Beautiful watch, but it's hard for it to keep accurate time. Always having to adjust!<br />As for the second watch I bought. Same thing, does not keep accurat time either. Either to slow or to fast!<br />Is their any possible way for replacement or refund?\n",
            "From china, i dont like it much, the case look nice but the leather trap is not good. Finally it is good for this price .\n",
            "The woefully inadequate instruction manual is absurdly ridicules. Recommend manufacture hire a native English speaker to write the instruction manual so that English readers can properly learn how to use this potentially useful tool.\n",
            "Love the new design! The writing is large and clear. Excellent for old eyes! Primary differences between this and the old Timex Ironman is that the programming buttons are in a different configuration. There is a learning curve involved. Also there is no hourly chime or at least I can't find it. Overall, it's a positive improvement on design. And hey, its a Timex so I know it's reliable!\n",

            "I got this watch for my birthday and I'm in love. I'm 17 with average proportions, not a land whale nor a stick, and it is just a tad too loose so I'm going to have to buy one of those kits to take in the band size. So if you are a petite woman I suggest buying one with your watch because it is likely be a bit loose.<br />Besides that I love it!!!!!<br />Took a few minutes to set it because directions did not come with it, but I looked them up on Fossil's website. It's on PDF page number 9, heading &#34;MULTIFUNCTION&#34; and subheading &#34;Multifunction 6P27 / 6P29 / 6P77 / 6P79 / VX3NE&#34;. Hope that helps because it took me forever to figure out which one was for which.<br />All in all 100% would recommend (and a big plus is it is way cheaper here on Amazon HOLLA).\n",
            "this watch is disappointing. The light stopped flashing after only two uses. The watch is cute but I bought it for the flashing feature.\n",

            "This Swiss Legend men's watch is an outstanding time piece. But it's not for those who prefer a small or thin watch. This watch is big and heavy. Nevertheless, it fits smoothly and comfortably on my wrist. I really don't notice it's girth any more than I notice my Movado.<br /><br />The Swiss Legend is a very well made watch. Upon close examination it is clear that each part has been carefully engineered and precisely machined. The function of all the component actions is flawless. I am especially impressed by the heavy band and latch. A pinch is all it takes to unlatch the band and yet it stays perfectly secure on your wrist until  you're ready to take it off.<br /><br />Overall, this is a highly attractive, precision made, intricate time piece that you will enjoy and admire. Amazon's price on this watch is an exceptional bargain as well.\n",
            "Ordered this watch band for a friend. He loves it fits just perfect.\n",
            "This is a great looking watch. When I first received it, the analog portion was non-functional due to a dead battery(this watch runs on 2 batteries, one for the digital and one for analog portions). Amazon was quick to exchange the product for free, and the new watch came in 100% working condition. The design really stands out and looks really cool. This watch also has a glow functionality for use in the dark! It's a pretty big and heavy watch, so keep that in mind when purchasing. I have thin wrists and it still looks great!\n",
            "It looks great, simpler to use than it seems and nylon band is my favorite so five stars.  The display is not brighter than it is dark and the light shows everything but only for like exactly a second or maybe even less, buttons are on the tough side of pushing and the band has a lot of sizes available for wrists and yeah it's cool but I don't think you can buy it in any US store so here the price is great too.\n",
            "I have bought two Timex and one Armitron watch in the past, neither were atomic watches. The kept time well, but the resin band broke on all three. I decided it would be a good idea to go with a metal band this time.  My dad had bought this watch in 2012 and so far the band had not broken and it worked perfectly. I purchased it as well, and I love it. The band is held together with metal pins that must be removed to adjust the size of the band. I was able to take out these pins without too much trouble.\n",
            "Its working properly and have a nice size. Unfortunately is a bit difficult sometimes see the hands due its color.\n",

            "Wife loved it.\n",
            "Awesome watch! It is durable, pretty and fits my tiny wrist. I work in EMS and I beat it up pretty good, it still is scratch free. The digital numbers are hard to read but nothing that particularly bothers me\n",
            "Cheap but gets the job done.\n",
            "Very good watch it's been almost a year since I bought it and I must say it still looks brand new. Thanks\n",
            "Perfect! Works great and does all i need. Easy to clean too.\n",
            "Love my watch. Exactly as I expected.\n",
            "This is a lovely watch to wear with turquoise. An interesting design.\n",
            "I'm very impressed with the watch itself. It feels heavy and high quality. The glass back is SUPER cool, you can see everything. What's even better is you don't have to risk scratching up that back to replace the battery. The only con I can see for some people with the watch part is that it is sure does tick quite a lot, six ticks per second from what I've read in other reviews. I haven't worn it to work yet, but if I'm alone in my office it might be monotonous.<br /><br />The band, however, is another story. First of all, it's black, and no one should ever wear black professionally unless you're a mortician. Parts of the mechanics are gold, so it really doesn't match. It arrived with some kind of sticky coating on it, getting on my fingers, even. I knew from the reviews and similar products, regardless of color, I wouldn't want this band. I ordered a genuine brown leather band at the same time and it looks stunning, but that's aside from this product so I had to knock a star off.\n",
            "° I've had it for over two years. It's now a paperweight, the strap broke without warning or provocation one month after the warranty expired. Still trying to find a replacement but it's impossible to find. I find this a rip-off and an insult to buyers!<br />° The watch is quite uncomfortable for topside use (heavy, won't fit under a standard shirt cuff) and the strap is hard. It is also not fit for diving by cause of the delicate aluminum bezel face and scratch prone case, unless you plan to keep it under your wetsuit cuff or glove gauntlet.<br />° The crown guard which doubles as bezel lock is the most stupid feature I've seen in a dive watch. I wonder how Mr. Cassell, the designer, boasts of enviable experience and cannot design a practical dive watch. The lock is impossible to open with a gloved hand so you must either enter the water with it open or put your gloves after setting the start of dive time.<br />° The lume plus tritium markings that initially atracted me to this piece are next to unusable. The lume is the cheapest I've seen in a watch over $1000 and fades away after 5 minutes, the hands lack lume paint, just tritium tubes and the bezel 0 marking is next to microscopic. Night diving? Bah!<br />° Look somewhere else for a diving piece!\n",
            "This watch is gorgeous, people think I paid anywhere from $300-$500 for it!\n",

            "Used for Apple Watch 38mm. Only complaint is that my wrists are small and I am fascinated on the laaaast ring, but no fault of the product. Will buy more straps from this brand! no concerns about security of the watch face... I did have to buy the adaptor clips for the Apple Watch to use this band.\n",
            "Absolutly love this watch.  It's light, sturdy, and it is really easy to read in the dark.  Wear it in the shower all the time and no problems at all.  Very comfortable.\n",

            "Great everday watch\n",
            "Its a pretty watch, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the strings that you use to tighten or loosen the watch hang funny and start to get really annoying. But if you have no problem with strings randomly rubbing your arm or getting wet when you wash your hands then you'll love this watch!\n",
            "I am not an individual to write reviews, as I don't feel it necessary to convey my personal opinion to the subjective audience, however, this is a dully-noted exception.<br />To begin, this watch is mechanically, artistically, and pragmatically superior to any timepiece I have seen on the market. It's allure in design suggests an auto-enthusiasts timepiece similar to that of the nameless AUTODROMO 'STRADALE'. In that, the red secondhand/face contributes to the design of the tachometer of an automobile/ motorcycle. The blackface is subtle and sleek, humble enough to blend into everyday life routines but pronounced enough to be noticed in the romantic moments. The face takes an intellectual perception to read properly at first, but it becomes natural after a day or two. Mechanically, this watch is silent, even in comparison to my CLYDA automatique from Paris (repaired by local ROLEX timekeepers), there is no match. To add to this, the practicality of this watch is a bonus. I imagined this watch to be worn solely at functions, meetings, casual get togethers, but the sheer compactness and feather-like-weight of this timepiece has slipped into bed with me at night unnoticed many times. I have immediately been praised for it amongst my acquaintances within two days of ownership. I highly encourage and recommend this to the men from all walks of life as it has the ingenuity for a common man but the luxuriousness fit for a king.\n",
            "My wife recomended me this watch for fathers' day and I bought it as my present. I loved it from the first moment. It's been two months and love it more every day.<br />Really awesome and big enough for my wrist.\n",
            "Very easy to bump the buttons and reset things compared to other similar watches and it is impossible (as far as I know) to turn off the hourly chime.  Setting things does not work the same way as other 4 button watches and the watch did not come with a manual.\n",
            "I received my watch in two days. I put it on and is very comfortable. This watch is a steal for only this price.\n",
            "This watch is comfortable.  Works well.  I can't see the smaller wheels but the time is clear.  It doesn't clash with anything I wear.\n",
            "I love it! It's my third Fossil watch!\n",
            "To be honest, I was taken in by the deep discount...paying $100 for a $500 watch.  Wow.  But if I had seen it in a store for a $100, I probably would not have bought it.  It's just a bit too clunky.  The bracelet is noisy.  But it is pretty.\n",
            "I've been wearing the Bertucci titanium field watch for a couple weeks now and have been really enjoying the seemingly weightlessness feel of this watch.The nylon strap is surprisingly very comfortable, and Can be adjusted to a perfect length to lay nicely under the two metal loops without having some extra flapping piece at the end to deal with.My wrist are average size I guess but with the ability to slide the body of the watch back and forth it's easy to find the right length and balance to fit any size I would imagine. The watch itself has gained about a min. In 2 weeks.I can live with that. The tan color of the hands and markers really blend smoothly with tan slightly gold shimmer of the band. The face is a little darker than expected but the luminous hands make up for it . I find it to be a understated yet handsome field watch, which is exactly what I wanted.Buy one, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n",
            "Another mistake by a seller. They gave this description for this watch--but the picture was for a totally different &#34;Pulsar Solar, silver faced, metal bracelet, chronograph watch. This started an agonizing series of phone calls--to Amazon--who recognized the conflicting description of a &#34;Pulsar Solar Watch with Brown Leather Band and the posted picture of the watch I described above. Finally, I was given the Seller's customer service number. I talked with several staff members and they finally admitted that they had really screwed up! I told a gal there I wanted the watch that was pictured--the Pulsar Solar Chronograph Watch with Metal Bracelet. She called to the warehouse supplier and told me &#34;It was available.&#34; I ordered it at that point. I received it within a normal time span. I opened the box to find the Pulsar Silver Faced Metal Bracelet Chronograph! I was happy! I put it in my window to charge it! There was however, no manual in the plastic Pulsar box!  When I took the watch from my window sill, I read the dial to find that it wasn't a &#34;PULSAR SOLAR,&#34; but a  'PULSAR QUARTZ CHRONOGRAPH!!!&#34; I called back to the seller and was offered a 50% reduction in price--if I would keep it. I took there offer! It has turned out to be a very accurate Pulsar Chronograph! It's a handsome watch and I'm quite happy wiith my savings. Pulsar is made by Seiko and consequentl,y the quality is very high. I called Seiko and was able to print a manual out online. It's complicated to set the chronograph functions up correctly but, after this is accomplished, it is very  accurate chronograph and timepiece.\n",

            "Bought this watch for my son and he really likes it.  Perfect size for him\n",
            "The Chinese bargain version of the German bargain version of the Swiss watch you've always wanted.<br /><br />All kidding aside, this watch requires the fewest bitten sheckels, and the least financial risk, for this style of watch. The automatic works as you could reasonably expect. The style is spot on, and gorgeous. Steel blue hands off axis, black straight on, print the perfect clone. Movement visible on the back, sapphire and stainless. Checks the requirements for a watch thrice the cost and half the value. Only real complaint is the size of the band: quality is acceptable and as genuine as a c bill allows, but the sizing is clearly not adequate, even for my rather mediocre wrist.<br /><br />Also, complaints concerning the crown didn't match my experience: stamped definitively &#34;R&#34; in my case. Really seems to be a very rare high value, low (relative) cost piece; a fine example of the best global ingenuity and manufacture has to offer with regards to consumer goods.\n",

            "Exactly what I wanted\n",
            "The use of the term &#34;Unisex&#34; for this watch in my opinion is misleading. The size of the watch face on a small woman's wrist is large. On my wife's wrist, the timepiece looks like a clown watch -- like oversized shoes a circus clown would wear. On my wrist it looks more suited for someone like myself (6' 0&#34; and she's ~ 5'5&#34;) with a slight build. So be aware of this when purchasing for a smaller male or female friend.\n",

            "I have had this watch for just over six years now and there is only one major complaint that I can make: the watch band is not the greatest (but how can one complain for the price?). I almost lost this watch because the watch band loop broke one day. It did not go through any abuse; once the loop breaks on this watch, it becomes easy for the watch to come off ones arm. Other than that, this watch has been enjoyable and is easy to read.\n",
            "The watch is great. It didn't include the extra band.\n",
            "Love this watch. The only downside comes from me having colorblindness. Makes the numbers a little hard to see in lower light unfortunately.\n",
            "This watchband more than met my expectations.  It fit well and was simple to install.  For the price, it was a good buy.  The shipping cost though was high almost doubling the cost of the watchband.  That was disappointing.\n",
            "This watch was a gift for my husband. He loves watches and has many different kinds. Really liked the style and roughness look of this watch. When I received it is feels a bit flimsy-cheap. Looks good on his wrist and he was happy with the watch.  Recommend this watch as a watch for kids or to have the look of rugged. Don't think I would trust it to perform in a stress test of nature.\n",
            "Love it! Light weight, easy to read and it lights up. Perfect for working outside.\n",
            "I really like the design, the details are very nice and make you looks very cool, woman or man can use that will look great with them! :))) ! AW things are incredible!!!\n",
            "I love it!\n",
            "Beautiful looking watch . I was quite disappointed on receiving the product to see it was not working as it should have . From dropping time to eventually not working at all within 2 days of getting the watch and me not wearing it once .\n",
            "Looks cheap, quality does not match the picture.\n",
            "This is a great looking watch, and though I've only had it for a day, it feels super-substantial. Easy to set, well-packaged, fairly thin (but not thin). I hardly need any of the chronometer features, but they do look cool and they work. Very comfortable strap, too.\n",
            "Looks great!\n",
            "Did not like this particular GShock, it was hard to read without pushing the backlight button.\n",
            "I'm happy with that choice!\n",
            "Great watch for the price, waterproof and durable. I never take it off and it works great!\n",
            "Not like the picture.  The previous band I had ordered from Amazon did look like this picture (but brown), but it was no longer available.  This band has a buckle and 3 metal rings, but the picture, and my preference, has only 2.  I did not find any use for the extra ring and its extra layer of material cluttering up the band, so I cut away the extra material with the attached ring.  Now it looks like the picture, and it works.  The rings are rectangular, not rounded nicely as in the pic and the previous band, and the material is closer to 1 mm than the previous 1.5 mm, but this band is usable and looks OK.\n",
            "I love this watch.  I get so many complements on it on a daily basis.\n",
            "It's a cheap poorly made product save you money and buy an Invicta\n",
            "No instructions included, too bulky in size, digital display not clear.\n",
            "Hi! Love this watch very beautiful.\n",
            "Love it! Chunky look and sturdy feel. I enjoy the versatility -dress up or down. Face is large enough but not over done. Great deal for a good price.\n",
            "Purchased on LD, my son loves these watches.\n",
            "the product looks great with the crystal, could be elegant too~\n",
            "Excellent\n",
            "I've had this watch for about 2 weeks now and it's the best watch ever, I get endless compliments. I was worried about it not fitting my very tiny wrist but to my surprise it did, I just used the last hole and it is a tiny bit loose but that just gives me room for slight movement. Also many people complained about the time and dates being off. I haven't had any issues with that, I set the days of the week in Spanish along with the numerical day and it has not changed at all. All you have to do is pay attention when setting it you'll see that it uses military time when setting, so when you put it to the correct day and time it does not change back. Over all best cheapest watch I've ever owned.\n",
            "Well beware of the numbers. The numbers shown here look very clear and not digital. When you get it the numbers are more digital looking and somewhat blurry. I was disappointed. The rest of the watch is fine. Just don't expect the numbers to look like it does here.\n",
            "Great price for a great watch!\n",
            "The design is delightful, the band is made of quality leather, and so far the watch keeps perfect time. The low score is because the first watch did not work at all. Quickly a replacement was sent.\n",
            "Thin plastic inlay around face of watch came unglued 5 minutes after removing from box. I would think it's just bad luck, but this is the second Timex sports watch (different models) I've bought with this defect. It's only cosmetic, but I've had enough of poor quality assurance Timex; won't buy another watch from them.\n",
            "Wife loves it!\n",
            "Nice looking, easy to operate, does the job, blue light can be turned on or off, has variable options for movement. Good purchase!\n",
            "Great watch! This is the second one that I have purchased in the last 5 years.\n",
            "It broke in just a few weeks. My son loved it though.\n",
            "So far it's been a good watch. I've only had it a few days. I do not like the watch band so probably will get another one for it. The band it's self is very stiff and kind of cheap. But for the price, I can't complain.<br />If I have any problems with it, I'll update.\n",
            "With the right tools, you could replace the strap yourself. Excellent quality & a genuine product!\n",
            "Large enough for old eyes as well as atractive\n",
            "This was a gift to my wife. She really likes it.\n",

            "Delivered Very Fast from the UK.\n",
            "Haven't wore this yet but it's a very nice watch for a night out in the city.\n",
            "Very nice and High quality! Love it\n",
            "I bought this for my mother, and she really liked it. It is a bit bigger than I expected it to be, nonetheless, it's beautiful. It has three buckles that you can switch to fit your wrist size - which she thought was very cool. It looks very luxurious, and I don't think you can beat it at that price.\n",
            "I love the watch itself, but unfortunately, it does not hold up for what i ordered it for.  I ordered it, expecting to be able to use it's bluetooth functioonality to connect with my phone.  unfortunately, having the latest version of software for my Galaxy Note means i'm unable to use the watch for the bluetooth purposes.  i'm still patiently waiting for Casio to get on the ball and upgrade their software, but my patience is wearing thin.  If you have android 5.0 or higher on your galaxy phones, do not buy this if you're hoping to use the bluetooth functionality.\n",
            "Grandson love the watch\n",
            "just cheap looking\n",
            "I am looking for a thin watch on Amazon but it seems that manufacturers are being very creative with their product dimensions. See photos. This watch is almost 10.5mm thick yet the web description touts its thickness as 3.5mm.  No instructions came with the watch, but I did manage to figure out how it operates without them.  One of its 3-dials acts as a 24-hr indicator while the other two dials act as a stop watch. One pushbutton on the side starts-stops the stopwatch while the other resets it. On the watch that I received the reset button did not return the dial to zero, but as the photo shows it reset to about 22minutes and 27seconds.  Also it seemed to me that the main minute hand was bowed and not straight causing it to barely miss the second hand as it passed over it.  I have asked the supplier to accept its return.  Update 8/28:  Supplier credited my card for the purchase and fixed the info on Amazon's web page. Prompt and responsible actions . Since they did not want the watch back I decided to try it.  However I was surprised to see that it had stopped working. So into the trash can.\n",

            "The watch really is a disappointment.  Please don't waste your money.  The band looks nothing like as nice as the picture.  It's cheap as can be and the clasp is too.  I am going to cut the leather (???) strips away and try to salvage something from this unfortunate purchase by using a bracelet band.  So far, the watch is running...........I will give it that.  It also took FOREVER to come; if the listing mentioned China, I missed that, but that's where it was mailed from.\n",
            "It's so pretty! I like this one!\n",
            "Amazing\n",

            "Nice watch\n",
            "I am 14 and I have a small wrist. I bought it and the quality is great and it looks amazing. But it was a bit big, so I had to poke a hole for my right size. Other than that, it's awesome!\n",

            "Love it!\n",
            "This combination watch and bangles is a very attractive set. My wife has very thin arms and finds most watches and bracelets don't fit her well. These did. This is not fine jewelry, but much better than average every-day jewelry. The watch, in particular is very nice and attractive. it is packaged in an attractive box set - suitable for gift giving.\n",
            "I am a watch lover. I have  Rolexes, Tudors, and Tags. I recently discovered these watches when shopping for my wife. I could not believe the incredible quality and value that Seiko is offering.  A true stainless steel, mechanical, automatic watch at this price! It is simply unbelievable.  But believe it...it's true.  I ordered the SNK809 with black strap. OK...the strap is not great.  You can have fun by adding a Hirsch or a NATO.  After this experience, I learned more and bought the Seiko SARB033 for myself. Seiko is incredible. The Japanese made watches are beautifuly designed and constructed. The SNK809 looks better... and IS a better watch than most of what is currently available under $500.00 At this price, buy this watch and have fun with it!\n",

            "I love being able to fix my own watch. This is so much better than paying $20-$30 at the shop.\n",
            "I just love the color. I bought this watch because I wanted a watch that can be fully submerged in water, and so far it works great. I need to figure out how to turn off the alarm... but other than that setup was easy.\n",
            "It is a decent looking watch.  Not my thing anymore so I would not buy again.\n",
            "Wow..it looks great!!!The band is a bit lighter than expected, but is very thick and rugged. A note on the band says that the it will get darker as the leather ages. I might occasionally switch the band for black one to match with my outfit, but the entire watch is of very high quality. I have gotten a lot of compliments since the very first day..I will buy one for my son..the thing looks like it could last for decades. It feels like it too. A definite buy..\n",
            "Shipping was very fast, I'm so glad to be a prime member. They have not let me down. The product was as promised and as advertised. I'm very pleased\n",
            "Very nice watch. Got it to match my grill.\n",
            "I got this for my son, who loves orange.  It's almost a little scarlet-ish orange, but he didn't mind.  He has very skinny wrists for a 15 year old, and this watch does not look too big on him.  He wears it all the time, and uses the alarm to wake  up in the morning.  He's had it for about 8 months, and so far no problems.\n",
            "Me and my husband both use it... I should get him his own. Great for the price. Only issue was it didn't come with instructions so we had to figure it out on our own.\n",
            "This watch is gorgeous, love the size of it, love the white enamel. I bought it to replace my 17yr. old Seiko 3M22 kinetic, titanium that I loved but I found the case is to small for me these days. But I can tell by the stem and the bracelet clasp that the quality does not compare with my old Seiko! I would still recommend.  :)\n",

            "My son loves this watch! He's 8 and this is his first big-kid watch.  It looks very tough.  It has a stopwatch, date, and time, and also a light feature. He's outside as we speak using it in the dark.  It adjusts well to wrist size,<br /><br />I liked that it was easy to set the time without pulling out my hair in distress.  I'm hoping it will be a bedtime incentive since he loves telling me the time. When I say it's 9:00 pm, time for bed, I'm sure he'll check to see if I'm right.<br /><br />Another cool thing is it comes in a round tin, a collectible like the Fossil tins.  He put it next to his bed for when he takes it off.  We're very pleased.<br /><br />I rec'd this as a sample for review and inspection at no charge.\n",
            "This is the watch I wear everyday.  Why: the classic look, the simplicity, and the durability.  Plus if I lose the watch, I can replace it easily enough.\n",

            "It's adorable but arrived broken 😂\n",
            "This watch looks very nice in the photos, but it's amazing in person.  It looks like a much much nicer watch in person.  This particular model is more or less for lefties, or those who wear watches for lefties, and it's huge.<br /><br />So it looks great; it's for lefties; and it's huge.  It's somehow more than that.  It wears the enormous size rather well.  It's not garish or cartoonish, and it's well proportioned.  The functions are feel are good, and while I'm more of a automatic/self wind kind of guy, but this quartz guy has won me over.  It's just that nice.\n",
            "I've been eyeing this watch for awhile and was happy when it went on sale. Upon receiving it, however, I discovered a major design flaw. Unlike most watches, this one does not have an extra little band to hold the end of the watch strap in place. So, because i have small wrists, the end of the strap sticks out in a most unflattering way. :( (See attached photo). I thought about tying a string or putting an elastic band, but I don't think I could deal with that aesthetically. So back it goes.\n",

I have a small wrist 6inches and it was no problem for a watch person to adjust for me.\n",

            "This is an inexpensive wrist watch with a huge face.  It keeps accurate time and also displays the date (but not the day of the week).  It has a hard-to-use chronograph as well.  The use of the crown to set the time and date is not intuitive.  For example you have to set the date to yesterday's date in order to have it show today's date.  It also makes a ticking sound.<br /><br />It is apparently designed to be worn on the right wrist by left-handed people as the crown and chronograph buttons are on the left side of the watch.<br /><br />The Swiss Legend company is not really Swiss; I believe their watches are assembled in Asia.\n",

It's held up through all my summer adventures, been submerged in water too many times to count, up mountains, down rivers, etc. The only reason it doesn't have five stars is the fact that the plastic scratched fairly quickly, but it's not something I mind.

The only cons are that sometimes the head (that also pushed down for a light up) feels like it may fall off, and that the alarm sound is a straight up beep instead of Star Wars themed music.\n",

            "It is a pretty decent watch.  Still runs after a few battery replacements.  I have turned into an automatic watch enthusiast at this point in time...  This means I would probably not buy this watch again because of my desire for automatics but if that doesn't matter to you as a buyer, go for this watch.\n",
            "WOW!!! WOW!!! WOW!!!<br /><br />Did I happen to mention, WOW! This is really a very nice watch. The features on it are simply amazing and I don't even think I have discovered all of them yet. The look of the watch is really something else. Very nice and it gets noticed a lot! I have received numerous compliments and people asking me if they could look at it, so it is obviously an attention getting timepiece and will surely get you noticed in a crowd. Well, at least the watch will get noticed.<br /><br />Now the very first thing that you absolutely need to do is read and follow the instruction manual to the letter in order to set-up and maintain your new watch. DON'T under any circumstances try and get everything set up without first reading the instruction manual. You will make some costly mistakes if you do and you could damage the watch and void the warranty. However, if you take your time and read the directions you should have no problem getting the watch set and understand how to use all of its features.<br /><br />This is a stainless steel watch and it is a bit on the large side and not one that is going to be unobtrusive by any stretch of the imagination. I have only had this watch for a few days and have already determined that I am not going to be wearing it on a daily basis, but more for special occasions and events rather than a daily timepiece. I did wear it all day for the first couple of days and I swear that I lost feeling in my left arm a time or two from the shear weight of this watch. Not really complaining mind you, simply commenting.<br /><br />Very impressed and highly recommended!<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.\n",

            "Looks good on your wrist and the moveable bezel lets everybody know it's a diver's watch. Bezel gets stiff and tuff to spin with buildup of oil and grime from daily non-diving use. It can lose a few minutes of time over the course of a week or 2-- but I use my cell phone time if I need precise time daily and ALWAYS sync my watch time if I'm depending on it. I wouldn't go for a dive without first checking to be sure my tanks were full; I check my watch accuracy if I'm counting on it no matter who made it and how much it cost. But only 4 stars because I think Seiko could do better in that department for this watch.\n",
            "I received the 1st watch a couple of weeks ago and it was not working.  I got in contact with the seller who sent me another watch and guess what this,one does not work either. I cant believe this. I just want a working watch.\n",
            "It stops intermittently after two months of use,  That's long enough so I can't return it.  The warrantee requires mailing it to Japan at my expense.\n",
            "Buyed this for my friend she loved it!\n",
            "I very much enjoy this watch. It is a heavy, substantial watch that looks terrific. I was surprised to learn it is movement-wound and stops running and has to be reset after less than a day of idleness. Unless you wear it every day, be aware you will need to buy a watch winder, which I did, if you don't want to be resetting it every time you wear it.\n",
            "This has a gray bead blasted type of finish. Functions just fine, but does not match the watch unless it has the same finish. I kept it because I doubt anyone will notice.\n",
            "Received the watch with a dead battery , very nice watch but I think it is unfair to pay $150 for a watch with a dead battery\n",
            "This item is wonderful, its a great purchase.\n",
            "great looking watch - but that dial bigger than I thought. Got an Expedition which is just the right size.\n",
            "Classic watch sure to get you some attention with the unique yet classy face. Plus you'll always know what time it is in Paris, London, NYC, etc. Ideal for you jet setting lifestyle\n",

            "The minimal contrast between the black watch face and the blackish watch hands made it impossible for me to tell what the time was without squinting and holding it under a bright light.\n",
            "I ordered a metal band, because I had an unused, brand new, beautiful, working watch, but I hate faux leather & fabric bands. They're sizes are too small & the material wears out quickly.<br /><br />Really like this watch band. It was the right size needed to attach to the watch, so I'm happy that it didn't need to be returned for something bigger/smaller. Love the pattern on the band, & it really does look like it belonged with the watch! I'm not used to stretch watches (the others all have clasps & extra removable links) so it'll take time to get used to the snug fit that stretch bands have. There's no doubt i'll try this again, if I see a watch I like, that needs a new band.\n",
            "This watch is pretty small. Works perfectly and the night light is very good (teal color). Very legible and durable in all conditions.\n",

            "My daughter's doctor recommended this so we bought it.  it's nice that she listens to the alarms better than her mom but it's not water resistant so she broke her first one.  It's a good watch but I think it's over-priced.\n",
            "the design is very modern and material looks cool. but it was written it was made from steel though I have an irrtation in my skin. so at the end I could not use this watch. I had to give it away\n",

            "I don't thing the under section is leather but still a great look and feel.\n",
            "I will try my best to describe this watch in its entirety!<br /><br />Quality: This watch has a nice NATO-style band which has a leather backing around the wrist strap holes. Only issue I have had with the strap is it easily gets caught on long sleeve clothing. So if you live in cold areas (Wisconsin!) or just really like to wear long sleeves, be careful! I had to pick small threads from my jackets and long sleeve tees that were embedded in the edges of the watch. The mineral face is high quality. It helps prevent scratches but is not unscratchable.<br /><br />Time Keeping: Since it is an automatic, it will not have Atomic Clock time keeping skills. You may lose up to a minute a day (Although this is the most you are going to lose). I normally lose 3-4 mins a week. Every watch is going to be different. (Some reviewers say there watch is fast and some say it is slow) I normally adjust it at the end of each week just to keep it &#34;sort of&#34; in sync. If this bothers you to not have an exact time and you are concerned with saying &#34;It's about 1:20ish&#34; instead of saying &#34;1:23 on the DOT&#34; then buy a Quartz watch.<br /><br />Design: This watch has a very unique and interesting design! First off, the design may be confusing right away but it is very easy to read after a few glances at it. (Hours on the inside with minutes on the outside) I actually love the fact of having the day and date on the watch as well. If a friend or teacher needed the date/day I could glance at my watch while everyone else is digging for a phone. Another plus is the clear back. It is interesting to see the watch movements and how the gears work.<br /><br />History: I actually researched the design of this watch (..Yeah, I'm a history nerd) After a few google searches, I found this style of watch was used by German pilots during World War 2. Pretty interesting history behind it. (Google &#34;B-Uhr watches&#34; for more info)<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Since this was my first watch, I wanted to make sure it was the one for me. And sure enough, it was! I am very glad to have purchased this watch and would happily buy another one for a gift. Very interesting and high quality design. I remember I was deciding between this and the Timex Weekender. I decided on the Seiko instead because of the date/day feature and the quietness of the Seiko. If you have ever heard the phrase &#34;Keeps a lickin' keeps on tickin&#34; that is Timex. It has a very loud second hand and that completely deterred me from buying it. I hope this review helped you decide on a watch. If you have questions, feel free to respond to this and I will get back as soon as I can!\n",
            "Nice\n",
            "Larger than I expected. For the money I can't complain and my 5 year old loves it!\n",
            "From what I can tell, through visiting a few watch-collectors/fanciers forums, this is not a bad watch for the price. But it’s neither Swiss nor legendary, though it does apparently have some Swiss-made movements. The “Swiss Legend” brand is Chinese-made, and the domestic company is based in Florida.<br /><br />The consensus seems to be that you could get a much better watch for a little more money. I don’t know. Just reporting what appears to be dominant opinions on the forums. Also: If you need service on the watch, that might be an iffy proposition.<br /><br />It is a nice-looking watch and seems solidly built. Aside from issues of quality, the size issue will be a determining factor for many: This watch is HUGE and not for the slender of wrist. Similar to the large Invicto watches.<br /><br />It looks fine (though larger than average) on my husband, who is 6’2”, 230# and “big-boned.”  On my slim friend, however—6’4” and 190#—the watchface is larger than the top of his wrist.  The result: it looks he’s a child wearing his father’s watch.<br /><br />Note:  This is a left-hander’s watch. If you wear the watch on your left wrist, the controls will be on the left side of the watch\n",
            "I would of given 5 stars... Because the feel of this ESQ is cheap band, watch has no weight. It's a very pretty watch, think $75 would be apprioate for this Movado.

I had 3 links removed and it fits exactly the way I wanted it to. It has a large face and it's heavy...I absolutely love this watch!  I can wear it dressed up or casual.  I get lots of complements on it.  The price from the seller was great compared to price in department stores.  The shipping was fast and it was packed well.  Very happy with my purchase!!!\n",

I wish that Orient made it a little smaller maybe 37 or 38 mm rather than 41 mm but I guess the larger watches are now in style and maybe I'll get used to the larger size. To me, this watch seems to have a even higher level of  quality than my older Seiko. Bulova and Gruen automatic watches.\n",

            "This a six+ year review. For that many  years I've swam, showered and knocked the humble T43892 around and true to the claim of yesteryears' adverts, this Timex is still ticking. It has been my 'beater' watch and it has more than capably served in that capacity.  This is the damage after all the years of abuse and neglect:: -- The original band gave up the ghost today. Truthfully, I should have retired it a while ago. -- The Timex's acrylic crystal has had a few polishings (courtesy of a dremel, cotton bit and some paste)to buff out accumulated scratches. -- New battery(ies)--I can't recall if I swapped out the battery once, or twice. By the way it's easily exchanged with a 000 Phillips screwdriver.  High value, inexpensive and robust: this watch embodies what a Timex should represent. I love the design: light thin case--it is plastic, easy to read face, integrated retention lug bars and, of course, Indiglo. This design, which Timex has unfortunately discontinued, has proven itself very durable.  The T43892 shows no signs of letting up but if it dies tomorrow I'd still consider it an excellent value.\n",

The screen is one of the best negative displays I've ever seen on a G-Shock. The back light is awesome and lights up the watch perfectly. I really enjoy the ability of setting a repeat timer too, excellent for the gym. It looks very rugged and I love the black colors on the buttons and the tang on the band. It's the perfect watch for a hard working man...great for law enforcement, military, sportsman, construction. Awesome watch!\n",

I bought this watch during my trip to USA and when I came back to India, within 1 week of use I saw some part of digital display missing characters. Buttons are also not very smooth and I'm getting a feeling that the buttons might get stuck or come off after couple of months. In general the watch is difficult to use and not very user friendly. I wish there was a repair centre in India where I could get the display fixed.<br /><br />On the good note, I liked 2 things:<br />1. It catches gps quite quickly and data is accurate<br />2. It has a long battery life<br /><br />If soleus people is reading this, can someone pls guide me on where I can get this repaired in India?\n",

            "My old sports watch was a Timex Ironman that lasted 20 years until the watchband broke.  I figured I'd replace it with another Timex.  I just needed something basic to take on my runs that was reliable and kept on ticking so to speak.<br /><br />This looked like a comparable replacement and the product description gave me no reason to think it wouldn't be.  I'm not sure if the one I received was just defective or if they are all this bad but it would only allow me to adjust hours and seconds and completely skip over the minutes when setting the time.  The other problem was the alarm was always set to on and I could not turn it off.  I did read the included instructions sheet to see if I missed anything and it's straightforward and everything should have worked.<br /><br />In the end, I decided it wasn't worth more than a 1/2 hour of stress to figure out how to fix it a $13 watch so I sent it back beeping in the box with no way to turn it off.  I ended up getting a Casio W210-1BV Classic Watch with 10-year battery life instead.  No hassles with that one... I just set it up out of the box in a minute or so it worked.\n",

My husband had his watch links removed and sized to his wrist in about 5 minutes (and we didn't have to pay a jeweler!)<br /><br />The watch wears nicely. It is not super light nor super heavy.

(May be because of the of the Moto 360 design )<br />This band actually cracked the back of My Moto 360 so be careful.<br />No watch Spring bars included (Seriously what the hell?)<br /><br />Design: 3.5<br />This Metal band overall looks great. On looks alone I highly recommend it. It also isn’t really that hard to add / remove links to make the band fit you better. I do wish that they made the band a tad more flexible though. I believe that this would have prevented it from crack the back of my Moto 360.<br /><br />Comfort: 4<br />For the most part this band feels nice on the wrist. As I stated earlier, at times it feels like this band is pulling on the hairs on your arm. I also think this band would have benefitted more if it was a tad more flexible.<br /><br />Price: 5<br />If one thing is right about this product it would be the price. You can’t go wrong at a $12.99 sticker tag.<br /><br />Average: 2.9<br />Via Amazon<br /><br />Thoughts<br />I liked this watch band but I did get a tad salty when my Moto 360’s back cracked because of it. So in the end i find it hard to recommend it to my friends .<br /><br />Score<br />15.4 / 20<br />77\n",

            "Great watch.  I've had this one for a few years now.  It's as tough nails and keeps accurate time.  I don't need a watch with a chronograph, calendar or any other function aside from telling me what time it is and this one does the job.<br /><br />You can soak the band in some Biz or Oxiclean and it will look as new as the day you first put the watch on.  The numbers really glow well in the dark (not like the dim &#34;indiglo&#34; watches) and are large enough to see at first glance.<br /><br />A fine watch\n",
            "Exactly what we were looking for as a Father's Day gift. It was a great remembrance piece for my husband.\n",

            "Had to give it 1 star, it couldn't properly keep time as the second hand would continually stop and start. Tried resetting it multiple times and it just wouldn't work. This will be the first item I've returned through Amazon.com... I'm sure the other watches work fine, I just got the bad one!! Thanks to Amazon for making it an easy return\n",

            "beautiful band<br />delivery was a little slow - I am an Amazon Prime member so the bar for delivery times has become irrationally high.<br />Was bought as a replacement for my 25 yr old Mickey Mouse watch so I can give it to my daughter.  My wife thought it wouldn't match but I (and my daughter) think it looks great.<br /><br />A bonus is that there is tiny lever in the band that you slide across to slip it into the watch - difficult to describe but this was unexpected and made installing very simple.\n",

            "I purchased same watch from Sam's, without the Japan movement.  Loses approx. a minute a week and has since new.  Spend a little more and get the Japan movement (keeps much better time from online reviews and my own experience with Seiko).\n",

            "It's a nice watch, but just smaller than what we were expected.\n",
            "I was not prepared to like this watch as much as I do. I generally don't love digital watches, preferring to actually tell time. But this face, while busy, is very clear. It is easy to see the time (including seconds), as well as the day and date. If you travel or work in multiple time zones, you can save three. The watch also has stopwatch and timer functions, and is water resistant to 330 feet.<br /><br />I was concerned that I would sweat under the plastic strap, but it is light enough and can sit loosely enough that I have no problem with it. The color is lovely, not a bright lime green, but more like a light &#34;Tiffany box&#34; turquoise. It actually matches my water bottle.<br /><br />And finally, I don't love bulky watches, and this watch is not bulky. It is light and easy to maneuver.<br /><br />For the price point (under $30 retail, less than $25 on Amazon) this is a stellar watch from Armitron.\n",
            "Simply works as desired. Perfect.\n",

            "I LOVE this MK watch! It's has style, medium weight and I love the  iridescent colors when any light hits it. Good feel, weight. I guess after I loose 20 pounds it won't be so tight.\n",

            "I love skagen watches, every one I've owned, but this is my all time favorite. I've had it for almost a year, wearing it 4-5 days a week all day and it still looks and runs perfect. It's simple, elegant, sophisticated and comfortable. It looks great with jeans and a t shirt or an evening gown, plus it's just the right size. If you're considering buying it for yourself or you're looking for the perfect gift for your wife or girlfriend, buy this one.\n",

            "Really happy with this watch. Perhaps the best ABC watch I've owned (and there have been many).<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fast, responsive screen and hands.<br />Countdown timer can count down from 99 days to 0. Not sure why I need 99 days, but the trend in many digital watches now is to only count down from 60 minutes. I like being able to countdown multiple hours - especially useful for things like flying.<br />Solar powered - I love that I never need to change a battery in my Tissot again. A+ on this feature..<br />Titanium case and sapphire glass.<br /><br />Cons (and these are pretty minor):<br />Did not come with a manual, however one is available online on the Tissot web site.<br />Unable to change barometric reading to inches of mercury (commonly used in the US). Readings are only available in hectopascals. (Hectopascals are used everywhere else except the US). Not a big deal, but you may have to do some conversion if calibrating against some weather reports.<br />Reverse LCD screen: while it looks goods on the watch, is a little hard to read in some lighting conditions.<br />Backlight could be better. The LCD lights up, but not the rest of the face.<br />Rubber strap has to be cut to fit. This means you have to be very careful when measuring the fit the first time. Measure twice, cut once - you'll have to buy a new strap if you mess this step up.<br />No temperature reading. Not a huge deal as they tend not be highly accurate on a watch, but would have liked to have seen it to round out the Meteo functionality.<br />Hands should be a little longer.<br />Would like to see a few additional features such as sunset, sunrise.<br /><br />But, overall, very pleased with this version, and would highly recommend this watch.\n",

            "I've had several other g-shock watches during my time in the Marines and they always worked well for me. This is the first watch I've purchased since I retired and I like the look of it. I like the larger display. With this watch at my age I can tell the time without having to put on my reading glasses. One of the main reasons I purchased this watch was for the compass but it's a little difficult for me at my age to read and still haven't really figured out how to use it but that might just take some working with it. It does have thermometer but that wasn't a big selling point. I also like the additional digital time for when traveling.  Overall I'd recommend it.\n",
            "I'm a watch lover - Betsey has great unusual watches, quality is good on all I've bought.<br />This one is a lot of fun.  Great contrast with denim.\n",
            "It's unique in design. I'm very impressed with their packaging.\n",
            "We love our clock. It is beautiful and the music is excellent quality.\n",
            "Love it! Great buy.\n",
            "Classic, standard, g-shock quality, at what I believe to be one of the lowest (if not the lowest) priced g-shock. Not flashy, but at the same time it looks good and cool. You can literally wear it doing anything, although you might want to take it off occasionally to clean it a bit, because it will gather up your sweat and dead skin cells and whatever else you come in contact with. Its a great watch, easy to use, great functions (stop watch, alarm, timer), and tells everything that you basically need to know (time am/pm and military, date, day of the week). Super sturdy and its been an essential for me, I wear it everyday for the most part. In the ocean, in the shower, in the hospital, playing basketball, you don't really need to worry about taking it off because it won't break. In fact you should take it off during basketball because you might hurt someone if you hit them in the face with the watch. It's pretty indestructible, just youtube the tests they put these watches through. It's reliability is part of what makes this watch so appealing. Its durability in combination with its classic design and many functions, its probably the best value watch to go for at its price.\n",
            "Broke after 18 months. Digital still works but analog needles no longer move. Changed the battery but did not help. When still working, it was an OK watch only. The hands often obscured the digital segments making them difficult to use, and the logic of the buttons still escapes me.\n",
            "very nice :)\n",
            "I purchased this watch for my best friend and he loved it. He wears it frequently when he has on blue. It looks great on him. The watch face is not too big, and the band is sturdy.\n",
            "This is a very nice watch. The quality is impressive for their price. I got it for my sister for her work and she loves it! Just the right amount of sparkle yet low key and not too flashy. Even has a plastic hold on knob to prevent it from running before it is purchased so you know you get the full life of the battery the minute you take the plastic safety off. I really like these watches. There are so many to choose from!\n",
            "very good.\n",
            "Definitely a showstopper - I get complimented on this piece constantly. Plus I get to have the time of my love overseas until we are together again. :) Everything worked great. The only thing that would be NICE, is a button for glowing hands or something like that. But considering the price, and the fact that most of us look to our phones for the time nowadays...I am NOT complaining. :)\n",
            "Perfect!  Exactly what an expensive watch deserves, particularly a dive watch (what they're intended for) that might end up on the bottom of the ocean if a spring bar fails.  Not all bands leave enough space for these chunky bars, but I would change the band before I'd give up these!\n",

            "The watch is very nice, as advertised. On my watch band there is a barely visible zig zag where the leather is pieced together. Also the back of one of the loops has a stitch on it that itched my wrist. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.\n",
            "I bought this watch to use while coaching. It's a very good looking watch and I end up using it casually as well. Really solid watch.\n",
            "very good, arrive within 14 days after payment. much cheaper than local store. and good quality.😃\n",
            "Just what my husband wanted . it meets all his expectations\n",
            "I only give it a four due to the fact there is NO luminescence at all. I am buying the chrono version for the light so at least I can wear it at night. I( bought it because it looks almost identical to a Bell & Ross 01-92 which is a $3000.00 watch. If this one had good bright lume, I'd buy ten of them. I do wish they had them in different colour faces, I'd buy on e in each colour for sure. Good watch for the money for sure.\n",
            "The one I received is totally not working. It never move a second. I am so surprised. Thanks Amazon, I can return it. I have to say, the watch looks nice. But it is not reliable. Tissot scared me.\n",
            "Overall,  it's a nice watch but the battery was dead when i received it.  I will just have to replace the battery.\n",
            "Best watch for the price totally satisfied fits great solid watch band and casing\n",
            "The band turned out to be the right style but the wrong size.  It looked to be of great quality, however, and the customer service for the return  (which was free) was excellent. It was worth taking the chance.\n",
            "Love this watch\n",
            "Came in as described. The watch was a bit too big for my wrist and a lot smaller than I anticipated but it was nice after having it resized.  Quick shipment!\n",
            "Ah gift well appreciated, very satisfied with the quality of the watch.\n",
            "This watch is very nice, comfy, stylish and modern. You can wear with sport or casual cloths. I totally like it... must have\n",
            "Great watch. My son loves it!!!\n",
            "Amazing and very large watch. So good looking and very strong construction. A great watch for a big and tall man.<br />Update nov. 8: the watch stared to fade off the silver color and broke the band.<br />I thing this Is not an every day use watch.\n",
            "Very reliable service. Great price for genuine product!\n",
            "PROS:<br />- Handsome contemporary watch for all occasions, rugged and accurate.<br />- Sharp looking watch without a stem because it's a digital watch with an analog face.<br />- Sleek watch band that should last forever.<br />CONS:<br />- The LED-based night-light is only good for reading the time, not the date.<br />- The watch body is thicker than most watches.\n",

            "This was to replace a well-used leather strap on my beloved Timex triathlon watch.  I noticed at first that it wasn't quite as nice as the previous strap---leather not as supple, and not shaped as well at the pin.  This however, was not the biggest problem.  Shortly after I put it on the watch, it fell off at the pin.  I thought I had not quite got it in the hole, and redid it.  Tragically, the next day, during a bus trip, it fell off again, and I lost the strap AND my favorite watch.  The problem is that the pin is cheaper and less sturdy than it should be--perhaps shorter, too. What a stupid way to cut corners, Timex!\n",

            "I'm envious of all those people who got this watch and loved it.  I had to wait an extra couple of weeks to get it, and when I did, it did not meet my expectations, not even the slightest.  I had a nearly impossible time pairing the HR belt to my watch and my Samsung 5 to the watch.  The program lagged so much and froze my android several tomes.  I even tried a different android as well as my ipad.  It was such a hassle and still didn't work to display HR data (or any data) that I didn't even try to get the text notification feature working, which I was so looking forward to. Completely useless to me without reliable and easy HR monitoring just for the initial test (I retried literally 52 times, and it might have paired twice, but no continuous data, so I don't think the connection kept).  And I was looking forward to using the HR monitoring under water.  Basically, either I got a real lemon or the technology isn't so smooth and reliable yet/my expectations were too high.  I can't believe all of these people who just love this watch.\n",

            "I dislike most G shock watches. I think they do get attention, but the bulkiness and the colors (might as well be a rubber band bracelet) is pointless. Most are trend watches.<br /><br />Now i have more then a few watches. But only one G shock 100 B ACR, which is my best watch regardless of the price. I bought 5 g shocks afterwards to try and get that same feeling, but returned every single one.<br /><br />i have found one that gives me the same feeling as my first G shock. Every function is useful, and every button serves a simple purpose. From a perspective of someone who is shallow in their choosing, (mostly citizen, bulova, and victorinox watches) I found a favorite. This watch is almost intimidating because aesthetically everything is in the right spot color scheme is just right, when you see it, but once it goes on your wrist... game over. also people don't mention this enought, the night light on it is awesome, only the minute dots, and hour numbers light up bright blue (not like a light at the bottom illuminating the face). Also has a feature where every time you look at the watch at night only, it will light up for you. Words can't do justice to the wow factor. Next time you take it off there will be a tan line on your wrist, from wearing it too long. If you scroll through countless selections of watches, trying to make up your mind and you're unsure, get this one. Absolute perfection.<br /><br />I'm not a collector or a hoarder of watches, but this is a g shock you can take to a board meeting or keep it on and get compliments on the ski slopes. i don't think we get to appreciate those wow's enough, but if you get a chance to open the box for this watch and put it on... it will change your life in a small way. How much more can you ask for from a small purchase!\n",
            "I love my mickey mouse watch..it is smaller than i wanted ,but thats ok.\n",
            "small watch but very nice one..\n",

            "Great! So elegant and sophisticated.\n",
            "This is a nice looking watch.  The blue is not quite as bright as the photo but is still lovely.  I had to get a jeweler to remove two links so it would fit snugly even though I have a larger than usual wrist, and is it very comfortable to wear.  My only criticism is that the case is rather thicker than I would like at around 1 cm but I can live with it.  It keeps good time and is OK to wear in the shower and swimming in the ocean or pool with no problems.  I like that it has a second hand and roman numerals rather than regular numbers.  I purposely did not want a date window since I think it makes the watch face looker cleaner and less cluttered.  It does not have luminous numerals and that is just fine for my taste.  All in all I am pleased with my purchase.\n",
            "The watch looks great and hopefully will function well too. Since it's a quartz there is no question of accuracy. The metallic bracelet is very smooth and weighty, and the dial is a little too flat and slim. I hope the rose gold colour lasts long. Perfume and other alcoholic solvents or solutions should be avoided. The crown, when pulled to adjust the date seems to have a very low margin between the date and time adjustment. Had to carefully pull it to adjust the date. Otherwise the watch is good for the price it's available, if one buys it from the authorized retailers, it's not worth what they are charging.\n",

            "Looks great, feels great.  Had to get 3 links removed at a jeweler for about $10, but the band is very comfortable and easy to use. An especially good size face if you don't want one of those newer fashionable monstrosities around your wrist.\n",

            "good\n",
            "The display is nice and the light is bright enough, but this is the worst alarm ever. It's quiet and only chimes for one minute.\n",

            "very cool design and very light to male exercise\n",
            "Very nice watch, it was a little difficult for me to figure out the settings. I like that it shows the date and has a nice time display so that I can time patient exercises. the last clear strapped watch I wore got very stained after wearing it for a few months. That has not happened with this watch and I've worn it daily for months.\n",
            "Beautiful looking watch, quite unique. Comfortable fit also. At first glance i thought the watch was not working because it does not have a second hand. I was wrong it is working perfectly..\n",
            "Beautiful watch - exactly as advertised and at a fantastic price\n",
            "Excelente producto\n",
            "It's a good watch.  It does everything that it should and it looks good I am happy with this watch and with the manufacturer as well.  I am alsolooking at more of their products and I've got my eye on a couple of their other designs.\n",
            "Classic, simple, refined, and clean looking watch at an outstanding price. Delivered on time, with proper documentation and packaging from the producer.\n",
            "Love it  but it looks kinda dark like it's already getting black\n",
            "I like the Skagen watches, but I really love this one.  It is elegant and can be worn to the office or out.\n",
            "It is a sleeper, the best mechanic movement from Seiko in an affordable watch.  It is the same 6R15 caliber as in the famous Sumo diving watch, which I also have and accuracy is extremely good for a mechanical watch.  Mine runs about 15 seconds slow in 21 days. without wearing it in a winder.  It evens up a little better when the watch is worn.  The 6R15 caliber far surpasses in accuracy the new 4R36.  This latter caliber is no better that its predecessor the 7S26 caliber except the two features, which it has in common with the 6R15, that it can be hand wound and it is hackable.  The watch is an excellent value, especially since it also has a sapphire window and it is very high quality.  Watches three times the price of this watch have no better features and accuracy.\n",
            "Beautiful watch that I haven't taken off since I have gotten it. I will buy another orient in the future\n",
            "Had this watch for a while now.. As a bartender I've put it to the test many times and it's held up very well. I've seen some bad reviews on the band but I think it's great. Has a very sleak look and doesn't feel too heavy on the wrist. Definitely recommend this one.\n",
            "Great pocket watch, The watch has kept perfect time since I received it.  The only problem is the embossing. The helmet should be a Vietnam era helmet rather than the newer helmet introduced 30 years after Vietnam that is used today.  The design approval team did not pay attention to such an obvious detail.\n",

            "Terrific watch. Great looking. I like it better than my Breitling. (Don't tell them).\n",
            "Great solid feel.  Definitely would recommend.  I used this beautiful engineer bracelet on my SKX009K2 which I put in place of the stock jubilee bracelet that comes with the SKX009K2.  Best choice ever.  This bracelet and watch together is a completely different presentation and feel.  If you prefer the jubilee I would recommend the aftermarket jubilee bracelet as the stock bracelet is too light and the appearance shows it.\n",

Good build and feels nice hut it's just so inaccurate. Also going swimming with this watch messes everything up because of the touchscreen.<br /><br />Update:<br />About 3 months after buying it the rubber band just snapped off.\n",
            "large watch, very comfortable.  Looked at it in silver--too shiny--black is just right.\n",
            "Awesome! Affordable, works great.  Easy setup right out of the box.  Very comfortable. Light is awesome, extremely easy to read at night.  Also has a variety of light options / colors...really cool!\n",

            "He likes it a lot. Was replacement for older similar watch.<br />Light on the wrist, had ordered a metal one that was way too heavy<br />for him. Sent back, quick refund, no hassle.<br />Thank you Amazon.\n",
            "I get so many compliments on this watch. I love it, but the band is still very stiff after a few weeks of wearing. It also is definitely losing time, but it's a cheap watch, so it was worth it still.\n",
            "Not bad. Said it was brown but the band that came on mine was black. Still not a bad product for the price. Only wish it would say if the watch is water proof or not. But it's cheap enough that I am sure I will get plenty of use out of it before I find out.\n",

            "Very little sound...<br />Good working..\n",
            "I like the watch. Usually, I wear more expensive watches but thought I'd add this one to my collection. Very heavy indicating, at least to me, that it was built with quality parts. I bought two I plan to give one yo my brother for Christmas. One caveat. Removing bracelet links to reduce the wrist size proved challenging for  me. Although I have done this several times on many different watches, this time I had more difficulty for some reason. Maybe it's me 😁\n",
            "This watch was way too big for my hubby's frame.  I'm sure there is nothing wrong with the watch itself.\n",
            "I like this, but i want that it came fast to my house please.....\n",
            "Didn't keep up with the time although it is considered scientific. This was set up according to the instruction sheet that was read before adjusting the time sequence so Zi think it may have been a lemon..... I hope the rest weren't like this one.\n",
            "This watch was in perfect,working condition. Very nice and clean. Only complaint was that the face was too small for my personal preference. Overall, great watch and great seller.\n",
            "Excellent watch, extremely accurate out of the box.  Easy to keep it going, built up full reserve in two days of wearing the watch.  It became my favorite watch in no time and I am a watch collector with well over two dozen good watches.  The blue dial is very nice and the luminescence lasts through the night if the watch is put under light for 8-10 seconds before turning in.  The window is made of sapphire which is the best material and increases the value of the watch also.  The watch can be obtained for a very good price from many vendors.\n",
            "Awesome looking timepiece! My husband loved it!\n",
            "Bought this for my husband for AIT. He loves it, however some of the settings that come from factory were a little annoying to him, he had to change them. Otherwise, it is perfect.\n",
            "Makes a strong statement.  Extremely handsome watch.  Sexy and great looking, the black stainless speaks power.  Not a light weight watch, heavy feel and weight, your guy will feel bold wearing this and love you for it.  Does not come in that icky orange box shown on description page, I am including the actual attractive box it will arrive in. Much better.  Also, for all you snorkel/scuba folks like us, I have added the information on this watch and what it can handle.  It is ranked IV.  This watch is a winner.\n",
            "Its a little big and thick, but a very nice watch for $35.00.  Replaces my Tag Heuer just fine at less than 1/10th the cost of having the Tag's battery replaced, with a cleaning.\n",
            "I got this for my younger brother, he loves it. He wears it every day and uses the compass functions for Scout stuff. It is a little difficult to figure out (you may need to reference the directions) but overall it works as advertised.\n",
            "This watch is awesome I'm going to buy one in every color\n",
            "Great watch, I never take if off.  Easy to use and love the accuracy.\n",

            "I love this watch\n",
            "I bought this just for fun and it's became my favorite watch. yeah the shipping took awhile but everyone that I've shown the watch to thinks it's really cool and expense. it was worth the wait, if I need to I would buy one again.\n",
            "watchband is very very inadequate, it's more like a woman's watch.\n",
            "Don't waste your money. I charged the watch, as per the instructions, and it would never work. Returned it the next day.\n",
            "Amazing product I would recommend it to anyone looking for a bulova\n",
            "Just as the previous reviewer mentioned, my watch also arrived with a dead battery. It's pretty frustrating to have to purchase a new watch battery, especially considering the price of this watch. Pretty disappointing.\n",
            "Amazing watch. Looks great, very well made. Couldn't be happier.\n",
            "Good,quality band  but should have been the double pin band\n",
            "My husband loves it! It's the right size for a 5,5&#34; frame.  Not too big, not too small. It  looks like the Rolex submariner and yet it carries it's own feature as an Invicta.\n",
            "It is very beautiful. Been getting lots of compliments.\n",
            "I've decided to return this watch. It lost more than 90 seconds of time in the first two days and according to it's specifications it shouldn't lose any more than a few seconds per week. In addition to the fact the one I purchased was defective, the watch has a few design flaws. The watch hands that you use to tell time are VERY difficult to read in most normal lighting situations and at most normal angles. You can easily see the chronograph seconds timer hand but it frequently takes seconds to even locate the minutes hand when reading the time. The watch is visually appealing and with a couple of minor changes to the contrast of the hands to make them easier to read this could be a great watch. The flyback chronograph feature and second time zone feature both work well. Unfortunately, overall, this watch does not meet my needs.\n",
            "cheap and only worked for 3 days\n",
            "A truly great product. You cannot even tell it is on the Gear Fit. No bubbles or anything FOLLOW the instructions and it will turn our great. It comes with 6 protectors but I only used 1 but there are 5 more for down the road.\n",
            "So enjoy my Timex watch!\n",
            "Great watch- it looks pretty classy and it's functional and can handle wear and tear!\n",
            "They don't look cheap and are do pretty.\n",
            "Perfect for everyday use, everyone should have one!!!!\n",
            "First, let's be clear: this is huge! Second, the crown has been on the opposite side on previous watches, so that's a change, though I think it was necessary due to size. Third, the large second hand is devoted to the chronograph so in normal operation, it's not going around, which is a bit odd.<br /><br />All that said, this watch is great. It is eye-catching and classic. It looks modern and hip. I feared the wristband would look boring, but it's far nicer than pictured. It functions as expected, and it isn't showing any wear yet.\n",
            "Smaller than it looked\n",
            "This was a gift for my daughter, she absolutely loves it! It is so well done, and does everything well.\n",
            "Excelente\n",
            "Excelent\n",
            "This is a great watch, but it is HUGE! I like larger watches, but this one made me feel like I was wearing a satellite dish on my wrist. Because of the size, I had to return it.\n",
            "It's a basic watch for my simple needs. I wear it on casual days and it looks good.\n",
            "What a fun, youthful design for a watch to wear with any shade of teal or turquoise.\n",
            "The watch looks good especially for the price. But the worst thing about the watch is that there is not pins to adjust the watch. You can only take out links. The watch is too loose for me but if I take out another link it becomes too tight. Other watches, you can make small changes by moving small notches, but not this watch. The other negative thing is how difficult it is to read the face of the watch. There are four Roman numerals and lines for the other numbers. It takes a second to figure out the time, but that's just me. There are also two external buttons, but they don't do anything--they're just for show.\n",
            "Where gifts that everyone where happy with and fair priced. Decent quality. Long chain.\n",
            "GREAT WATCH BAND. GREAT ADJUST ABILITY!!\n",
            "Simple and nice. I loved it.\n",
            "Works great! A must have for any military\n",
            "Excellent product. Durable and accurate.\n",
            "Excellent! Totally silent. Product exactly as advertised. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Highly recommend.\n",
            "Cheaply made, you get what you pay for.\n",
            "Beautiful but the strap little too long\n",
            "I wore twice and while wearing it the second time the glass face fell off. Horrible product won't recommend to anyone.\n",
            "The front glass fell out of my watch within the first week I had it. But it keeps on ticking holding the correct time still.\n",
            "Excellent watch.  Smaller than other G-Shocks and suits my wrist.\n",
            "I just received the watch and so far this review is on looks only. But what an AWESOME looking watch, especially for the price! I would have paid way more for the same watch but it looks even better than the pictures! The blue shows up so well and you can watch all the cranks, it is awesome!  update: This watch still works amazingly! One of my favorites, I get compliments a lot!\n",
            "I had owned this watch previously, but lost it. I liked the look of it so much that I decided to repurchase it, but this time online. It looks exactly as I expected and works fine. I like that it comes with three removable links that I can remove myself to fit my wrist. My only problem with it is that one of the pins that holds two links together was not completely inserted. I need to take it to a watch repair shop to have this fixed. I wish I could have worn it right out of the box, but no such luck.\n",
            "stopped working after 2 days\n",
            "This watch was for my sister and she love it! I picked it form her watch list and I knew she will like it, but she said the product is made with good quality and this made me look good too because was a birthday present\n",
            "This is a very attractive **HUGE** watch. It is BIG and round and THICK and HEAVY. Much too big for my wrist. But it is pretty. I sent it back.\n",
            "was not the quality I expected. The packaging was also poor quality.\n",
            "This watch looks even better in person then online. I've had a lot of people stopping to ask what the watch is. Very very happy with this purchase.\n",
            "This is such a great watch! It's hip and looks good on women and men 👍🏽.\n",
            "I really like my new watch; color, size, band texture, weight and style. I looks &#34;Great in my watch case collection.\n",
            "Beautiful watch!!  I look forward to never needing to replace batteries. I got the wrong instruction book- one for model V175 - but I didn't have trouble setting it and getting it going.\n",
            "I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He has a Michael Kors collection of watches.  The band on this one was the perfect size.  He did not need to have any links removed.  P.S. He loved it.  He wanted this one for a while but it sold out fast on the Michael Kors Website.  Plus it was cheaper at Amazon.  Win Win!!\n",
            "I have a water-proof girly watch :) . Now I know the date and time at work! I hope this watch lasts for many years!!\n",
            "Loved it!!\n",
            "This was easy to install. The directions were very clear and I followed them to a T. No bubbles with a clean fit, if I did not know there was a screen protector it would not at all be obvious. I wish my smartphone protector (different brand) was this easy.\n",
            "Best watch I've ever bought.\n",
            "My 15 year old son Love It, now I can rest from my son, he always looking to use all my watch collection, recommended..!\n",
            "My mom loves the set, being able to change the bands to match her outfits.\n",
            "Beautiful watch at a great price!\n",
            "beautiful\n",
            "this watch is awesome looking......<br />I to give away as a gift......and I keep it.......very nice ....thanks a million\n",
            "Love the watch. Great colors\n",
            "Looks better in the pictures\n",
            "Nice\n",
            "Beautiful watch, but anyone who delivers a watch at this price, with a dead battery, deserves a 0 star... Sadly, I cannot go lower than 1 star.<br /><br />If you order this watch, be prepared to spend a little more for a new battery.\n",
            "Stopped working almost immediately; seller gave me the option of a new one or my money back. I chose money back.\n",
            "love the quality of this leather straps... the cool feature is that you never have to remove the pins at the lugs... all you have to do is insert the open end in the lug and you got a nice, secure fit in the lug... very cool and innovative design... it also comes with its own lug pin\n",
            "For the price this is awesome, I am happy with my purchase. I think it feels a little cheap and its very light for being a metal band, I just expected it to be heavier but it fits good, feels secure I'm not worried about it becoming unhinged or the clasp not holding and my watch falling off. I work in a auto shop which is why I wanted a metal band and this makes my watch look just as good as with the original asus zenwatch leather strap. I have gotten so many compliments on it, everyone thinks it's the apple watch. I'm not an apple fan but I will give them credit for making nice products, so I haven't decided to take it as a good thing or not. My only gripe is that I would like for the locking mechanism on the clasp to lock from both sides instead of just one, I think that would just make it even harder to come undone over time. Like I said for the price this is a good buy, looks nice, feels nice, I'm happy.\n",
            "nice for the price one of the best watch I have purchase\n",
            "This is a fun little watch. I'm not in love with it, but I'll get to that. It's an interesting piece because it's different. It's not the best way to tell time because it has no increments between hours. The main concern I have is that the face looks to plasticy -- meaning, they should change the description of the face to more accurately reflect what the face is made out of. As I said though, I would buy it again because it's definitely unique, which is what I was looking for.\n",
            "It arrived one day early in perfect condition. It seems to be exactly as described. The dial backlight feature is very effective and useful in low light or no light conditions.\n",
            "It's amazing! I couldn't be happier with it.\n",
            "Had an eco-drive for 14 years and lost it,  this is a great watch.\n",
            "Pleased with my purchase... never knew there were so few mechanical watches made these days. What good is a cheap digital watch (or an expensive one) if we ever have an EMP attack or solar storm that affects the grid and electronics? Planning to buy another for my teenage boy in case we need to coordinate movements... he likes how it looks too. The only downside I can see some thinking it has is that you do need to wind it every 36 hours or so... but that is the point of no batteries, eh?\n",
            "Got as birthday gift for friend. He loves it. It's a steal for the price\n",
            "Awesome!\n",
            "Still wearing this watch on the daily a year later.\n",
            "This watch is perfect if you want to actually be able to tell time and not much else...other than have a cool watch:) It's unisex but has plenty of adjustments for my thin wrist, so easily fits. I got this because I was sick of looking at my phone for the time and I do NOT want a watch that behaves like a phone.\n",
            "Very handsome & unique wristwatch, very high quality, very comfortable to wear.\n",
            "Just did not like it on\n",
            "Great price. Great watch. I wear it in the ocean every day.\n",
            "Great for 5 months then water creeps in and it's done. Plus when we bought it, it came with a 2 year warranty ... amazingly, it too seems to have gone away. Amazon = Alibaba = trash products. Sorry, but often true.\n",
            "Perfect! I love it!\n",
            "Gorgeous watch but if you have a thin wrist it will be very loose.\n",
            "Recieved today. A nice looking watch, with the face pattern mirroring the band marking.\n",
            "A great look\n",
            "Everybody gave me a compliment for this watch !!\n",
            "I love this product and yes I will be order it again it another color blue....thank you!!!!\n",
            "can't beat it for the price.\n",
            "Band broke in half out of nowhere at dinner the first night I wore it.  Love the brand but disappointed in this particular lemon.  Hope to resolve the issue with the seller.\n",
            "I would add another star to this watch!!! It's extremely eye catcher, and really looks BIG!!! Amazon service is outstanding, the shiping on time, and the box very clean. I'm planing to get some of them for gifts. Congratulations!!!\n",
            "Looks good in picture but it's huge... And my wrist are tiny.... But still a really nice watch...\n",
            "You can't beat the price. Especially when it comes with 3 bands. The watch face is VERY small. Like child's size watch small. I have small wrists and it is still tiny. Craftsmanship is clearly lacking already. It has not run for 24 hours consecutively since I bought it. The watch stops daily. Buy this for the bands or if you don't care about checking the time\n",
            "Great watch bands\n",
            "The watch fits perfectly on my wrist and I have already received so many compliments on how it looks.\n",
            "Beautiful watch. The face is the perfect size for my smaller wrists.  Only downside is that it is a little loud, although not anywhere as loud as my Timex Weekender.\n",
            "everything Excellent\n",
            "Doesn't matter how pretty it is if it doesn't even last a year.  Eventually wouldn't auto wind or hold a manual wind.  At that price, I expected better quality.\n",
            "the face is a bit small to actually read well but love the look\n",
            "wonderful watch.\n",
            "Looks great, but hat to send back because the small Day hand was loose. Not sure I can trust this product to reorder\n",
            "Very easy to read.  Stay charged with no effort.  Thickness of the watch is such that it will not catch on clothing easily.  Have had the watch less than a month, and so far I love it.\n",
            "Like that I don't have to wind or put a battery in it\n",
            "This is a great watch. The white leather band and the wooden face really pop. Also since they're neutral colors the watch should work with a wide range of outfits. It just feels very modern/hip/cool. The watch itself is very light. Very comfortable when you're wearing it. I could see it working for men and women.<br /><br />The watch face is a good size and it's clean. Not too big and not too tiny. Very minimalist with only the hour/minute/second hands and the Woodies logo visible. I will say that the Woodies logo appears slightly off center on my watch. However, I think that's the aesthetic the company was going for. I dig the font. I haven't taken the watch near water but I'm sure it can handle a few splashes here and there. I would be careful to dry the wood off asap though.<br /><br />The watch is very quiet. It doesn't make that annoying ticking sound you get from Timex watches. I haven't had to change the battery yet but it looks simple enough to change. There are four tiny screws on the back of the watch.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is definitely a great watch to add to your collection if you're looking for something that is fashionable and functional.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I purchased this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.\n",

            "Horrible experience. Watch is reasonable, but the unnecessarily over-engineered clasp mechanism broke within a week of normal day-today wear. I will be returning this item. Stay away!\n",
            "Bought this for my fiancée and she loves it. The exact one she wanted too. Rose good looks nice and according to her very stylish!\n",
            "The watch looks like a million bucks.  My husband has had numerous compliments from other men on the watch's looks.  So far, the watch has functioned well.  We are happy with this purchase.\n",
            "Good design; better for heavy outdoor work, such as logging, than a wrist watch.  Clips easily to a belt loop from which position it is easy to read.  The light is easy to operate and very handy.\n",

            "Sleek and stylish. My friends introduced me to the gold looking watches for that classy feel. This one is just about right at 43mm. I normally wear a 45mm watch that I feel is perfect but the 43mm gives it a subtle sleek look and I'm not hating. Plus, if you're tanned it looks better!\n",
            "it works great  but i am having a hard time adjusting it to my wrist size because i am a little smaller than the Mens standard. size\n",
            "My wife bought this for me for my birthday, and I am in love.  Something about this watch just feels... right.  I have been wearing it for a little over a week now all day every day.  It is not too heavy, I forget it is on now.  I have a nickel allergy, and have had 0 issues with the watch.  It keeps time very well.  I had to set it twice, once when I first got it and once the next day, and it has not been off at all since.  I can tell time to within 2 or 3 minutes if I read it standing still, and within 5 minutes when I am walking/driving.<br /><br />I found the nearest sasquatch and had them try it on to take some pictures.  It really does look amazing in person.<br /><br />Edit:  I have wanted to love this watch, but the movement stopped working correctly after about 4 months, and despite battery replacement, stopped completely.  I sent it in for Asurion warranty service 3 times, but it never returned to full functionality and stopped again after each service.  I so wish I could love this watch because I really did enjoy using it, but the movement has not been reliable and the warranty service has been even worse.  Therefore I cannot recommend it.\n",
            "Fine watch\n",
            "Nice watch, a bit smaller than I thought but it doesn the job.\n",
            "It loses about a minute per week. I think that very good for an automatic watch. I also like the durable band it's attached to.\n",
            "It LOOKS identically to the one I have; however it does not have the &#34;indiglo&#34; feature like my other one.  It was hard to disguinish that from the photo.  I would not buy another one....\n",
            "Does its job, great price and has a cool vintage look\n",
            "Excellent seller recommend\n",
            "I paid $55 for this watch, they have the list price at $695, which is baloney (do not pay that much, obviously).  But for $55, I am happy with it.  But best to think of it as simply a cheap watch.  For example, none of the chronograph dials don't work at all on mine.  Perhaps mine is just a defect, but that is a pretty big defect.  If I bought it at a store I would take it back, but in this case (a negative of Amazon), it is too much trouble and not worth it.  So, I accept that the dials are just fake to make it look fancier.<br />It is quite heavy, and very thick - so, it might be a bit too big for my wrist (certainly it would never slide under the cuff of a long-sleave dress shirt), but that's ok.  I still like it, and if you prefer heavy, thick watches then you will really like it.  It is exactly as the pitcures and the little video show it.  And one thing that I also like which is hard to see from the pictures is that the band is thick and feels very durable, but is still very flexible and comfortable.<br />For $55, my rating is 4 stars as a cheap watch.  For $695 I would be screaming that I got totally ripped off.\n",

            "Love it\n",
            "Love this simple little watch. I'm still trying to read the mini encyclopedia that came with it however to try and use all the functions.  I wear this watch everyday with every sport, tennis, running, at the gym. Its not heavy.  I'm not really into counting calories or steps etc. I know I do a lot so I don't need to try and measure my daily functions. No heart rate, no GPS, no step counter, but it has a stop watch, split for laps, date, you can save a few speed run times. I really like it.\n",

            "Amazing watch. Boyfriend loved it.\n",
            "As  watch lover, this is a HO-HUM watch. I got it for the chronograph and tritium lights. I was hoping for more. It feels cheap and cheesy. You need a magnifying glass to see the date.  I prefer mechanical, automatic watches but the really good ones are beyond my budget. I guess I'll keep the watch just so I can see the time at night and it's water proof.\n",
            "Loved it!\n",

            "The price for this watch is amazing!  It is so worth it and more!  The face is a little larger then the watch I used to wear, but I really like it.  The silicone band is really comfortable and it moves with you and doesn't cut in.  The numbers are large and easy to read.  At this price, I will probably buy another one for myself, as well as a couple for gifts for friends!\n",

            "EXCELENTE\n",
            "It is an attractive watch. It's a bit too thick and a bit too heavy for me. The buttons are too hard to press. The biggest issue I have with the watch is that the white hands are hard to see against the white watch-face with a quick glance in less than perfect light. One last complaint is that the watch tick is loud enough to hear in a quiet room even when your wrist is a few feet away from your ear.  I really like the looks of the watch but due to the issues mentioned above, I will be sending it back.\n",
            "I have gotten so many complements on this watch. Everyone always asks, &#34;omg! Where did you get that?! Must have cost you a small fortune!&#34;<br /><br />Gorgeous watch through and through. Strongly recommend for all music lovers out there. It's a great buy!\n",
            "great\n",
            "This watch is great. Dial is of decent size, numbers easy to read. I have a few things that I find slightly annoying but not quite a deal breaker. First the indigo light button is a little off in that when you are in other operating modes such as the chrono and timer you can't operate it. Second if you are operating in seperate modes such as chrono and timer the watch will change back to the time mode leaving whatever mode you are in. I only mention this because quite often I'll do 30 second sprints followed by a lift and rather than having the watch stay in timer mode it switches back to the time mode. I know they are small things but I thought worth mentioning.\n",
            "This was a gift for my sister. Very simple and basic watch, but cool color.\n",
            "Was psyched that I was able to find this on amazon for an amazing price. Just bummed that the battery only lasted about a month after I received the watch. That's super unusual since all my other G-shock watches have lasted 4-6 years before needing battery replacement.\n",
            "Still looking good and running strong\n",
            "Nice watch, well-established design.  Brand new, new packaging, but dead battery in less than two weeks.  Must have been on the shelf for a LONG time.\n",

            "I bought this watch for my husband,  he was expecting a bigger Invicta watch. This watch is normal size but it's Ok for him. For me I like it and works fine.\n",
            "For the price you can't go wrong. It's comfortable and I don't have to worry about damaging it. A perfect work watch!\n",
            "Bought it for my dad and he loves it.\n",
            "Excellent watch\n",
            "The tic-tac sound could be less annoying... it is loud in my opinion. It is a cheap decent watch. I like the back-light function and it looks more resistant than I would expect for this price.\n",
            "One of the greatest purchases imaginable. It works like a dream, looks like a fantasy, and is even as heavy and thick as a $30 watch I have. Thing is a must-have as far as accessories go.\n",
            "Bought it for my Dad....Its been 2 years now and still looks new. Awesome Product!\n",
            "It's watch bling!<br />Great piece\n",
            "This is a nice looking, well made watch that is quite accurate at keeping the time.  The only negative thing I can say about the product is that the band is just a bit too small for me.  I understand that at 6'6&#34; and 250lbs I'm larger than average so I can give them a pass on that one and I will just have to pick up a larger watch band.<br /><br />The watch runs off an internal battery and if it does last the 2.5 years they rate it at I will be very happy.  The controls are simple with a single dial used to adjust the time and day of the week / date portion of the watch.  Even without instructions it was easy to figure out how to set the watch with pulling it out slightly letting you change the day of the week and date and pulling it out fully let you adjust the time.<br /><br />The watch itself is a perfect size for my wrist and I like the white numbers on black background as it makes it easy to see the time quickly and easily.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice watch, if you're giving it as a gift to a taller / larger guy you might want to get a larger band to go with it.  Recommended.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.\n",
            "Very bright.  I especially like the NATO cloth/nylon band included as most rubber bands on watches like this are annoying and uncomfortable.\n",

            "Can't say much about this watch that hasnt been said already. But overall the watch is great. Everything is what I expected (including battery life). Coming from a Pebble watch, I knew that it was going to be a challenge since i never thought about charging my watch normally, and at most would connect my watch 2 out of three days a week. I love the watch and although I'll miss the battery life, I really like the ability to interact directly with a lot of the features on my phone, easy tasker integration, and lots of watchfaces. I could have easily gone with the new pebble time, but wanted a change from pebble, and felt that the numerous screen tearing issues were just frustrating. I went through three regular pebble watches. Moving to this watch has been a breeze. Found a decent app that gave me good watchfaces, and now I've got a Pip Boy watchface. People have been saying to wait until the new version comes out, and if you can wait, then maybe you should to see how everything pans out. But if you're in the market for a new watch, definitely look into picking this watch up.\n",

            "Got this last Christmas (2014)  Less than year old and loses time.  I've replace the battery twice.  It gets stuck randomly for some unknown reason.  I can't trust it.  =(  Looks nice, just can't count on it.  Is this common with Invicta??\n",

            "Very great build---obviously a quality strap that is certainly worth the money invested. If you've a Pebble Time, or similar watch profile, this will solve the annoyance from &#34;watch-turn&#34;--that annoying sensation of your watch falling onto the backside of your wrist. (Those of us with smaller wrists, this is the bane of our existence and likely why we don't wear watches.<br /><br />The band is exceptionally tough and dries very fast after being immersed. My only complaint isn't to do with the seller, or the product, but with the shipper. USPS is, by-and-large, the WORST shipper I have ever dealt with. To give you an idea, I ordered a 20-pound sewing serger, with Amazon gift wrapping, during the WEEK FOLLOWING when my band was due here, and the larger product arrived, to my house, before my band did. And when I called the Post Office? Hah--&#34;we'll conduct an investigation into it&#34;<br /><br />Only after that call were the week-old updates finally given any sort of refresh, and then, they indicated that this package sat in Brooklyn FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK. The seller paid for Priority Shipping and I'm almost certain it would have made it in the same time-frame had they chosen standard mail. The worst part about this? There is literally no recourse that can be taken to show USPS just how terrible they are, other than refusing to use their service. Any Amazon seller that reads this, make the switch to UPS---they actually give a crap whether your customer gets their stuff.<br /><br />All that being said, B and R Bands Customer service, when I called wondering where my band was was absolutely superb--they empathized with me and told me that the only reason they chose USPS (since they were well aware of their level of competency) was to provide the customer with a cheaper shipping option--I can't fault them for caring about my wallet. And the next band I need, I WILL be checking their inventory first, because you just don't get that kind of follow-up and follow through from anyone else.<br /><br />Keep on rocking, B and R Bands!\n",

            "This is my third Citizens Eco-drive watch so it is clear I really like these watches.  As long as it gets sunlight, the eco-drive mechanism never needs any attention and keeps incredibly accurate time over very long (years) stretches of time.  I bought this particular watch because I wanted an attractive watch for dressier occasions.  The gold watch matched to a very nice looking expandable gold watch band fits the bill perfectly.  The watch face is champagne colored which I liked much more than the white faced eco-drive I also considered.  The watch is 36mm in diameter which is small by today's standards, but I like the smaller diameter.  I had my doubts about the expandable watch band, but once I got it properly fitted (two tries) I find it is very comfortable and looks terrific.  The watch is minimally water resistant - to sweat and light rain.  Overall this watch is exactly what I was looking for, and I can wholeheartedly recommend the Eco-drive mechanism.\n",
            "Awesome watch.  Only issue is the extra directional dial (N,S,E,W) is worthless. But looks great and performs flawlessly.\n",

            "Nice looking watch\n",

            "This is a gorgeous watch that you really need to see in person. Yes it looks nice in pictures, but up close it is stunning. First, I love the elegant packaging- very sturdy, sharp, and presents the watch beautifully. The instructions are clear and it is simple to set, plus it comes with the full international warranty. It is a nice heavy weight, indicative of the quality of the piece. The clasp is solid. The gold overlay is pristine- it shines without looking flashy/gaudy. The watch face is clean, very easy to read, and looks classy. This watch can definitely be used every day, and would be just as appropriate to wear for a dressy occasion. I am extremely pleased with my purchase, and will look at purchasing other Alexander watches in the future without hesitation.\n",

            "So far its a great watch, i know i just recently got it but wow. The color scheme looks great it gives off a kind of military style, but it still can be worn with most everything, this isnt a fancy looking watch, the black version looks nicer but still this is pretty nice, the packaging almost makes me not want to throw it out..\n",

            "I've never had a bad experience with a Timex product until I bought this watch a couple of months ago. That said, Timex is still my go to company for reliable watches, but this particular model is just consistently unreliable in my experience. The original watch I ordered worked as expected for a month, but one day entered a permanent unresponsive state where all I could do was view the time: No buttons responded whatsoever. I assumed that this was a rare defect and that having it sent to Timex under warranty would resolve the issue, but I was mistaken. Timex sent a replacement that began to malfunction even faster than the original (I started to notice the issue within 2 weeks, which only got worse). The light would sporadically go on and off by itself and would usually engage indiglo mode repeatedly as well. Because of this, it was beeping every few seconds whenever indiglo was turned on or off and I just had to go outside and throw it away before I lost my mind.<br /><br />I guess I'll have to go back to using my 6 year old Iron Man watch until I can find a newer model that won't suffer from these absurd issues.\n",
